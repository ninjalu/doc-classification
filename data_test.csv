58,20201125  the new protocol on the control of firearms ammunition and related materials was adopted by heads of state at the southern african development community sadc summit in august 2020 it provides countries in the region with a framework for combating the proliferation of small arms and light weapons the revised protocol is the first regional instrument to incorporate the african union au roadmap for silencing the guns a team from the institute for security studies iss worked with the sadc secretariat to identify gaps in the original 2001 protocol which predated the au’s formation and was obsolete in key areas all relevant regional african and international treaties resolutions strategies action plans protocols and conventions were compiled to create a baseline against which to evaluate the 2001 document the aim was to update the protocol with african and international arms control developments these include contemporary regional instruments like the 2010 kinshasa convention which regulates small arms and light weapons in central africa as well as the united nation’s 2014 arms trade treaty which encourages states to restrict the export of weapons which may be used for human rights abuses    given that development can’t take place in violent and ungovernable societies sustainable development goal target 164 and its aim to significantly reduce illicit arms flows by 2030 was also taken into account the sadc process began in june 2019 and the adoption of the new protocol just over a year later was achieved in record time for concluding international agreements this is attributed to the importance that sadc states attach to disarmament and silencing the guns the revised protocol reflects broad consultations by the sadc secretariat and collaboration with civil society organisations such as the iss in crafting some of its new provisions the new sadc protocol was adopted in record time for concluding international agreements ‘there was a need to bring the protocol up to date with african and global arms policy’ says iss researcher gugu dube ‘the 2001 protocol was a product of the postcold war era characterised by territoriality and secrecy predating today’s commitment to regional cooperation on crossborder issues such as organised crime and the weapons trade’ information sharing around regional firearms control needed to be strengthened another gap was guidance on safe management and storage of weapons including stockpiling and maintenance of government firearms record keeping of weapons lost stolen recovered confiscated or destroyed and tracking and marking weapons the 2001 protocol also lacked information on how to deal with excess and obsolete weapons and needed updating to include an electronic weapons database the revised protocol includes a total of 15 new clauses a zerodraft was presented to a sadc technical committee in maputo in august 2019 the process gave sadc’s legal police and military representatives the opportunity to understand and agree on the rationale for each amendment enabling them to develop a common understanding among member states ‘the protocol was adopted article by article in a transformative process which saw ownership of the new protocol pass from a small group of initial drafters to a community of people who will implement and enforce it’ says iss researcher richard chelin the new protocol calls for sadc member states to ratify or accede to regional continental and international arms control instruments it will help africa make its voice heard during revisions to the un programme of action to prevent combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons the revised protocol is just the first step to tackle problems posed by small arms and light weapons often referred to as africa’s weapons of mass destruction the challenge lies in the practical implementation which requires sadc countries to translate the protocols provisions into actions the sadc secretariat will now establish an implementation task team charged with developing an action plan that sets out timelines responsibilities sources of financing and assesses member states’ needs and capacity for more information contact martin ewi iss email protected 27 760 791 075 you can also  subscribe to events media releases iss today and specific topics get the iss weekly to stay ahead of africa’s human security challenges,3

336,foreign ministers of nato member nations meet today for a twoday conference to discuss the future of the alliance as the organization searches for relevance ahead of the impending joe biden presidency  the alliance has spent the last two decades finding purpose in its afghanistan mission but with us interest waning and troops departing it’s in search of a new raison d’être  pivot to asia the group appears to have found its motivation in a challenger thousands of miles from its borders a new report due to be reviewed at today’s meeting calls for fresh thinking on dealing with a rising china including deepening ties with asian allies and increasing technological capabilities  a wess mitchell one of the report’s coauthors and a former assistant secretary of state for europe laid out the core message in an interview with the new york times “nato has to adapt itself for an era of strategic rivalry with russia and china for the return of a geopolitical competition that has a military dimension but also a political one’’ he said  the shift in focus is in line with a draft european commission report that seeks to engage the united states in a new spirit of cooperation including on subjects as far apart as digital regulation and deforestation nato’s posture should also catch biden’s eye he has championed the alliance in the past and whose administration looks set to continue the asia “rebalance” embraced by the obama administration   public support remains high despite its identity crisis nato’s supporters can take some solace in public support for the organization a pew survey taken in 2019 found that public support is relatively high and largely unchanged over the past decade 82 percent of poles approve of the alliance and the median approval rating across members states is 53 percent france and germany have seen the biggest drops in support among european members with just 49 percent and 57 percent respectively holding a favorable view of the organization in 2019  the turkey problem the outlier in those polls is turkey where only 21 percent of those polled held a favorable view of nato while 55 percent thought of the organization unfavorably turkey’s membership in nato is starting to make less and less sense by the day exemplified by its de facto alliance with russia in the aftermath of the nagornokarabakh conflict and its insistence on adopting russia’s s400 air defense system against the wishes of washington  what we’re following today  opec decision oil producing nations are expected to decide today on whether to increase production in the new year after a day of talks failed to yield a resolution on monday opec countries were due to increase production by 19 million barrels per day in january as part of a groupwide cut agreed in april but the stillsluggish global demand for oil has prompted a rethink the likely outcome according to bloomberg reporting is a threemonth extension to production cuts although disagreements remain between cartel members on the exact terms of the deal  vaccine standoff the head of the us food and drug administration fda stephen hahn will visit the white house today amid frustration at the speed of the agency’s approval process for coronavirus vaccines the decision to summon hahn comes as trump administration officials offering differing accounts of when vaccines will begin being distributed robert redfield the director of the centers for disease prevention and control cdc has said the pfizer vaccine should be available as soon as dec 10 although an fda official responsible for approving the vaccine said it could take “a few weeks” the news comes as the us reported a total of 4 million cases of the coronavirus in the month of november a figure higher than any country has recorded in total over the course of the entire pandemic except for brazil and india   us supreme court hears international child labor case the us supreme court will hear arguments in a case that will help determine whether us corporations can be held responsible for human rights abuses committed abroad the plaintiffs in the case allege that nestlé and cargill are liable for “aiding and abetting child slavery” for allowing child labor on cocoa farms that they control in ivory coast both corporations argue they can’t be held liable and that they are not directly responsible for any harm caused  keep an eye on  scottish independence scottish first minister nicola sturgeon has called for an independence referendum “in the early part of the new parliament” ahead of scottish parliamentary elections in may sturgeon made the remarks in an address at a scottish national party snp conference although scottish voters rejected independence by a 5545 percent margin in 2014 recent polls show a majority in favor of secession likely due to the strong support for the european union among scots westminster would have to give edinburgh permission to hold another referendum and sturgeon has said she will take the british government to court if they block a vote writing in foreign policy jamie maxwell explains why boris johnson may have inadvertently furthered sturgeon’s cause  somaliakenya tensions somalia has expelled its kenyan ambassador and recalled its own from nairobi alleging that kenya had interfered in its electoral procedures in the state of jubaland while providing no evidence the news was announced via a facebook post by somalia’s foreign ministry and according to their kenyan counterparts no formal communication has been made about the ambassador’s removal  brazil’s rainforest the level of deforestation in brazil’s amazon rainforest has hit a 12year high according to official data released on monday 11088 square kilometers 4281 square miles of rainforest was destroyed in 2020 a 95 percent increase since 2019 although deforestation has increased under the presidency of jair bolsonaro monday’s figures left some room for optimism 2020’s 95 percent increase was much lower than in 2019 when deforestation was 34 percent higher than the previous year  odds and ends  tensions are fermenting between south korea and china after a chinese news outlet claimed china was leading the way on a traditional korean dish the spat begins with kimchi a fermented vegetable dish that is a mainstay of korean cuisine but that goes by the name of pao cai in china complicated further by a similar chinese dish also called pao cai the global standards body iso recently published new regulations for the storage and transport of the chinese variant prompting the global times to crow that china was leading the world in kimchi standards  the comment caused such anger on social media that korea’s agricultural ministry issued a statement that international standards for kimchi were already set by the united nations in 2001 and attempted to set the record straight once and for all “it is inappropriate to report the pao cai certification without differentiating kimchi from pao cai of china’s sichuan” it said,1
65,the uk government announced this week that it will cut its annual foreign aid spending from 07 percent of gdp to 05 percent  a decision that could have a significant impact on vulnerable people in the middle east chancellor rishi sunak made the announcement on wednesday as part of the government’s annual spending review sunak said the drop in funds which amounts to about £4bn a year was a “temporary” measure to help deal with the coronavirus crisis at home  we cannot genuinely claim to be global britain nor serious about creating postconflict strategies for countries like libya and yemen that could lead to great uk prosperity when our hard power is not matched by our soft power  tobias elwood mp the move has been widely criticised including by three former prime ministers gordon brown david cameron and tony blair the archbishop of canterbury justin welby nobel peace prize laureate malala yousafzai and over 200 charities and ngos  baroness sugg government minister for sustainable development overseas territories and the caribbean resigned over the decision calling it “fundamentally wrong”  meanwhile conservative mp and chair of the defence select committee tobias elwood said that the aid cut would lead to a “vacuum in some of the poorest countries in the world” which china and russia may “extend their authoritarian influence” into as a result  “we cannot genuinely claim to be global britain nor serious about creating postconflict strategies for countries like libya and yemen that could lead to great uk prosperity when our hard power is not matched by our soft power” elwood said  libya and yemen are among several countries in the middle east and north africa that currently receive official development assistance from the uk government and could be affected by the sizeable cut in funds  the most recent figures from the foreign commonwealth and development office fcdo released in september 2020 show that countries in the middle east are among the highest recipients of uk aid  wartorn yemen and syria were in the top 10 countries to receive uk aid money in 2019 at £260m and £223m respectively the vast majority of this was on humanitarian assistance with yemen and syria by far the two highest recipients of uk humanitarian aid last year  lebanon £149m jordan £131m and sudan £93m also featured in the top 20 recipients of british aid they were closely followed by the occupied west bank and besieged gaza strip £81m and iraq £56m  with countries in the middle east and north africa receiving over £1bn in bilateral aid annually it is highly likely several countries in the region will see a drop in funds as a result of the significant cut announced by sunak  asked by middle east eye whether crucial funds to the region would suffer from the decision a uk government spokesperson said  “we will continue to use uk aid to help the world’s poorest and to combat humanitarian crises this will include investment into new british capabilities to address conflict and instability in the places where we can make the greatest difference” in yemen a particular concern among some ngos is that the uk may in fact be doing more to cause the countrys humanitarian crisis than to combat it  the uk has consistently sold arms to a saudiled coalition that has carried out more than 20000 air strikes in yemen since the civil war broke out in 2015 onethird of those strikes have been on nonmilitary sites including schools factories and hospitals according to the yemen data project global charity oxfam which provides humanitarian support in yemen said last week that g20 countries had exported arms to saudi arabia worth three times the value of aid given to yemen since 2015  making billions from arms exports which fuel the conflict while providing a small fraction of that in aid to yemen is both immoral and incoherent the world’s wealthiest nations cannot continue to put profits above the yemeni people” muhsin siddiquey oxfam’s yemen country director said the decision to cut the aid budget while increasing military spending shows the warped and totally inappropriate priorities of this government  andrew smith caat with regards to the uk specifically the campaign against arms trade caat said the government had licensed £54bn of arms sales to saudi arabia between 2015 and 2020 significantly more than it has given in aid to yemen over the same period the figure for arms sold to riyadh is likely to be even higher as it doesn’t include open licences granted which allow an unlimited transfer of some weapon types “nobody can eat a gun” andrew smith of caat told middle east eye “unfortunately even before the budget cut was announced the sums which have been given to yemen are a fraction of the value of the weapons that have been sold to the saudiled coalition that is inflicting the bombardment”  smith said that uk prime minister boris johnson and his colleagues “bear a great deal of responsibility for the crisis” johnson announced plans last week to increase military spending by £165bn over four years a rise of more than 10 percent this comes as new research showed just how wide britains military presence in the middle east is with over 23 bases across the region  “the decision to cut the aid budget while increasing military spending shows the warped and totally inappropriate priorities of this government the consequences of this disgraceful decision will be felt by people in desperate situations” smith said figures released in april showed that the uk government had spent over £3bn in aid since 2012 to address the crisis resulting from the war in syria  syria has directly received £14bn of that while neighbouring countries including lebanon £678m jordan £654m and turkey £354m also received funds to help refugees displaced by the conflict  “syria is currently experiencing the worst economic crisis it has seen since the start of the war almost a decade ago over nine million people now lack adequate access to food  more than at any other time during the conflict” a spokesperson for the international rescue committee irc told mee  “the price of bread has increased by 300 percent since january this year alone and there are also many more children begging in the streets and a growing number involved in hard labour” last month images of people in syria’s capital damascus being forced to wait in cages while queueing for bread sparked condemnation on social media   “we don’t yet know where the cuts will fall but we hope that despite this announcement the uk government will continue to prioritise funding to the most vulnerable and conflict affected including those in syria” the irc spokesperson said  meanwhile palestinian refugees in the region will also be worried about a cut in british funding last year the uk government contributed £56m to unrwa the un agency for palestinian refugees it also committed £335m of new funds to the agency in july this year when asked by mee the fcdo did not specify whether the aid cut would impact funds to help palestinian refugees  unrwa is already cashstrapped and said earlier this month that it had “never recovered” from the total us funding cut imposed by president donald trump in 2018  “despite the immense efforts to raise sufficient funds in 2020 to maintain unrwa’s critical services to 57 million palestinian refugees across the middle east… unrwa has run out of money” agency spokesperson tamara alrifai said “if we do not have additional funding by the end of this month november then we will have to enact really disheartening measures that will affect the salaries of our frontline 28000 unrwa staff in the middle of a global health emergency”   view the discussion thread  © middle east eye 2020  all

343,once a country loses its sense of national identity a national unraveling is often not far behind  november 13 2020 308 pm protrump and antitrump demonstrators argue at the michigan state capitol on nov 08 2020 in lansing michigan john mooregetty images during a trip to iraq a few years ago i spent some time in sulaymaniyah where among a variety of interesting people i met with a group of kurdish university students at one point in our conversation i asked the students “what set of ideas principles history and national narrative do you share with university students in baghdad or basra” their collective answer was “nothing” it struck me that this was the heart of iraq’s problem if iraqis could not agree on a shared set of ideas about what it meant to be iraqi the country seemed fated to exist in an extended condition of terminal collapse this is not a piece about how the united states is just like iraq but americans have never been as different from the rest of the world as they reflexively believe and just like many other countries in the middle east and elsewhere the united states must confront the pathological state of its identity specifically i’m referring to national identity—the ways in which americans define themselves their relationship to the state and their relationships to each other of course we all have what social scientists call “identity repertoires” parts of which we emphasize at different times based on circumstance instructive here is an old friend’s twitter display name “abu el gamecock” which reflects that he is an american of egyptian heritage who grew up in south carolina and is a diehard fan of the university of south carolina’s gamecocks as he explained to me many years ago he is an american when he is among egyptians an arab among americans and an egyptian among arabs political leaders often use identity to advance their own interests or those of their country after coming to power in egypt abdel fattah alsisi sought to recast egyptian nationalism in a way that exiled his archenemy the muslim brotherhood from national belonging saudi and iranian leaders have at times framed their regional competition in terms of religious identity the problem of course is that it’s much harder to negotiate and resolve conflicts when they are expressed as a struggle between sunni and shiite what does this all have to do with the united states quite a lot when i was in sulaymaniyah chatting with the kurdish university students i remember thinking about how different the outlook among iraqi kurds and iraqi arabs was from americans it was an article of faith for me that even though i came from a distinct region of the united states and had my own distinct family history i still shared basic ideas about what it meant to be an american with people around the country of course i’ve come to realize that this was a little naive and itself a product of my unique experiences and education given how people of color women immigrants and others continue to confront injustice still i don’t think i was being too credulous to believe or maybe it was hope that large numbers of americans could agree on the founding ethos of the country and the sense that even if we had not lived up to them we wanted nevertheless to strive to achieve them that was proved by the friendships i had with people with whom i otherwise had little in common and with whom i disagree on almost all political issues take for example a colleague of mine from the upper midwest at first our only means of communication were the cultural touchstones of being teenagers in the 1980s—part of our identity repertoire in time however we have discovered that we believe in many of the same core principles and ideas that undergird our identity as americans—freedom the rule of law and equal opportunity to name a few—even though we vote in very different ways yet recently i have come to question whether this is true in a general sense do enough americans share a sense of national belonging that we can even still refer to a common national identity did we ever over the last four years president donald trump has revealed—and deepened—aspects of american society that sow doubt in my mind i have recently been reading a book about the united states up to and through the civil war the parallels between our current situation and the antebellum period are stark and disturbing but i’d long believed that the country’s subsequent trials and triumphs—reconstruction world war i the great depression world war ii the civil rights movement the cold war globalization and the technology revolution—knit the country together by forging a common identity that history produced myths about america’s national project that everyone could share in of course america’s national story was not always the sundrenched stuff of president ronald reagan’s “morning in america” reconstruction failed and we are still living with the legacies of jim crow america’s present immigration policies are a stain on the country and despite the inspiring success of vice presidentelect kamala harris women remain underpaid underappreciated and often abused in too many spheres of american life but the mythimbued narrative that became central to american identity served an important unifying purpose among the best physical manifestations of that identity is—as its builders intended it to be—the arlington memorial bridge linking washington dc to virginia with the lincoln memorial at one end and the arlington national cemetery and robert e lee’s home at the other again while many americans are left out by the bridge’s intended symbolism it is the form of this gesture toward unity and common identity that is important to preserve the bridge has been undergoing construction work for the last few years but what it means symbolically seems to have been lost given our inability to have a dialogue it is an open question whether americans even want to forge a common identity this has worrying similarities with how those i spoke to in sulaymaniyah thought about their country they and their fellow citizens elsewhere in the country have suffered dire consequences as a result of their inability to agree on what it means to be iraqi to the point of rejecting the idea itself in the case of many kurds contested identity in the middle east has manifested itself in political instability violence and civil conflict americans—despite what we tell ourselves about our exceptionalism—are not immune to a similar fate steven a

179,your fp insider access eastern europeans are returning home in droves here’s what that means for eastern europe’s economies—and the european union  missiles remotely fired with the assistance of a us base on german soil killed my family in yemen but neither german nor us courts are willing to hold anyone accountable biden’s landing teams are steering clear of an administration that has often served as a covid19 superspreader event the eu vows to seize the opportunity posed by the new us administration—but muddled strategy still stands in the way                               argument                                                       europe needed borders coronavirus built them                                                      europe needed borders coronavirus built t                          in 1996 a group of european scientists academics civil servants and artists met in the portuguese town of coimbra to discuss european identity does it exist and if so what does it mean all the participants made personal deeply intellectual contributions but many pointed out that as long as it remains unclear where the european union ends and who belongs to it and who doesn’t european political objectives remain vague how can citizens identify with vague political objectives maryon mcdonald an anthropologist said “identity is constructed relationally the clearest identity is in conceptual opposition you know most clearly who you are through what you are not it is relatively easy to feel ‘european’ when visiting japan for example” now consider what europe is doing during the coronavirus pandemic it is starting to draw borders a marked difference between “us” and “others” is slowly emerging leading to a stronger sense of belonging among europeans this has already had political ramifications the exercise in coimbra was a call for a demarcation of geographical boundaries common values and political goals during the cold war those boundaries had been there drawn by external circumstances at that time it was clear who europeans were and what they stood for because it was also clear who they were not and what their opponents stood for after 1989 that distinction disappeared borders were erased enemies became friends and by welcoming countries that had been behind the iron curtain the eu gave them perspective this it was argued would help prevent a dangerous vacuum along europe’s external borders but where were those borders exactly nobody knew this anymore everything was blurred would ukraine join the eu would turkey a muslim country how would this change the cozy christian club many europeans posed such questions politicians never answered them they didn’t know the answers themselves this fueled euroskepticism enlargement fatigue and a growing demand for migration stops and more security can partly be traced back to this now in 2020 something remarkable is happening the era of vagueness seems to be coming to an end boundaries are getting erected between europeans and the rest of the world—mental boundaries and physical ones there are many reasons why this is happening brexit for example has forced europe to put up a border with the united kingdom borders are also a response to terror attacks in recent years but the coronavirus pandemic is a more powerful catalyst initially the pandemic led to chaos in europe every eu member state issued its own national measures this was perhaps inevitable public health is not a european competence but with some countries hermetically closed and others confiscating shipments of their neighbors’ face masks the european internal market was seriously disrupted this shocked eu governments into action whatever their differences they all know that european postwar peace and prosperity depend on the internal market the market is europe’s economic and political foundation no eu government wanted to give that up immediately they got organized they fasttracked procedures for trucks at internal borders the “green lanes” system sent one another medical equipment and arranged financial assistance for affected regions during the euro crisis it took them three four years to set up a rescue fund this year a 750 billioneuro recovery fund was set up in three or four months involving a revolutionary joint debt issuance mechanism via the eu budget this gave “solidarity” some new meaning suddenly germans sang “bella ciao” for italians in lockdown french and dutch covid19 patients were treated for free in germany lawyers took time off to work in hospitals people bought groceries for each other a new mood emerged in european society german sociologist heinz bude said “the idea of individuals being able to fend for themselves rings hollow now … the days when freedom was the greatest good are over now shelter and protection become more important” back in march italians were burning european flags as the country became europe’s first to suffer a major outbreak they felt abandoned why didn’t europe help chinese and russian planes displaying their flags had delivered the first face masks in lombardy suddenly cynical outsiders were seen as the good guys but this image changed quickly many chinese masks were unusable and by the end of march europe was jolted into action—medically financially and logistically this “has given the eu a new image” eu foreign minister josep borrell told el país in a roundabout way what really helped was other countries trying to weaken the eu during the pandemic turkey opened its border with greece encouraging refugees and migrants to go to europe it also started drilling in greek and cypriot waters russia spread online conspiracy theories about the pandemic it propped up the president of belarus who had committed voting fraud and turned on his own people while europe was in lockdown the united states its old ally slammed tariffs on european products threatened companies building the nord stream 2 pipeline with sanctions and withdrew thousands of soldiers from germany china complicated the world health organization’s search for the origin of the virus and invaded hong kong while trying to force contracts with huawei down european governments’ throats this opposition from strongmen trying to take advantage of european vulnerability alerted many europeans what kind of mercantile world were they suddenly living in us sanctions against the international criminal court the poisoning of russian opposition leader alexei navalny the british government tearing up the exit agreement with the eu—all this probably did more for european unification than decades of subsidies from brussels in the euro crisis and migration crisis european countries fell into the nationalsovereign reflex but covid19 brought europeans closer together because the pandemic has coincided with geopolitical developments leaving europe in the cold the bulgarian political scientist ivan krastev said in a public debate last summer “this is about our place in the world it’s about european sovereignty and the need to reduce our vulnerability this is new” in march the eu closed its external borders with third countries that had never happened before european commission president ursula von der leyen traveled to greece’s border with turkey and said that europe showed solidarity with greece and would not be bullied with helicopters and armed border guards as a backdrop the message was implicit but clear this is where europe stops turkey which has been a candidate country to join the eu since 1999 was thus indirectly told that accession is off the table but europeans heard it too there is a historical parallel the habsburg empire which the eu resembles in many ways had no borders with the ottoman empire for a long time but in the 18th century when infectious diseases came from ottoman territory the habsburgs built their first border posts with watchtowers and quarantine buildings for travelers luggage and merchandise thousands of border guards were appointed from all corners of the empire it was a tremendous exercise europe is doing something similar now—again triggered by a pandemic greece for example which reluctantly gave shelter to migrants from turkey is now pushing them back over the border this is a clear violation of international law but europe looks the other way apparently borders now take precedence over human rights in a speech in berlin in 2013 theneuropean council president herman van rompuy said that europe had long been a space to roam around in and explore diversity now it was becoming “a place where we can feel at home” indeed while most citizens want europe’s internal borders to remain open they insist that external borders be better policed and controlled but human rights the rule of law and democracy are high on their priority list too this sounds like a contradiction frontex europe’s border guard that has just been beefed up from a few hundred to 10000 already stands accused of human rights violations some members of the european parliament have recently called on its director to resign but others insist that once external borders are better guarded it will be easier to set up a functioning eu asylum and migration policy and erase some of these shameful practices ten years ago europe seemed divided into cosmopolitans and nationalists now many including cosmopolitans say that europe can no longer count on others and needs to be “strategically autonomous” borders and demarcation are part of this autonomy—“l’europe qui protège” french president emmanuel macron calls it europe once a community of choice is becoming a community of need many europeans not just nationalists fear losing control in a dangerous world they are beginning to see the eu as a means to strengthen national sovereignty they may still not be happy with the eu but they are certainly happier in it german bundestag president wolfgang schäuble a hardliner during the euro crisis recently called in an oped in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung for more european sovereignty former finnish prime minister alexander stubb who directs the european university institute in florence italy said europe has “bloody well beaten itself through this crisis” in foreign affairs the researcher max bergmann wrote that europe has been “a geopolitical nonentity since the 1990s” but “will emerge from this crisis a stronger more unified global player” this doesn’t mean that a european identity will suddenly emerge or that european politics will suffer no more setbacks anyone saying that would ignore the nature of european integration and be hopelessly naive—the bitter fight over the rule of law in europe with the multiyear eu budget and coronavirus recovery fund as hostages is a case in point still it could mean that the eu and nonmembers such as norway and switzerland slowly get some sense of direction and cohesion again after years of aimlessly floating around in her 1919 essay prometheus the dutch writer carry van bruggen wrote that people always want to belong but if they get too involved in a group they will lose their individuality “being different from others is the condition for selfpreservation” perhaps today’s europe is discovering just that     caroline de gruyter is a europe correspondent and columnist for the dutch newspaper nrc handelsblad

considered a banking trojan used to steal financial data since then it has evolved into a fullfledged operation and appears in different types of malware campaigns trickbot has been spotted working with emotet to deliver ryuk ransomware it uses the eternalblue exploit to spread across hosts in a target network via server message block  earlier this year us cyber command and a microsoftled private industry group attempted to take trickbot down weeks later researchers noticed a new version being distributed via spam now its attempting to infiltrate the lowest level of target devices by checking for firmware flaws researchers with eclypsium and advanced intelligence advintel report a module they found in october 2020 marks a significant step in the evolution of trickbot a threat that has consistently incorporated new capabilities to become stealthier and more malicious over time in this module trickbot uses a driver from the rweverything tool to interact with the spi controller and check if the bios control register is unlocked and contents of the bios region can be changed rweverything readwrite everything the researchers say could let an attacker write to the firmware on virtually any device component including the spi controller that controls the system firmware this would let the attacker write code to the system firmware ensuring the malicious code executes before the operating system during the boot process the focus on uefi in this socalled trickboot module indicates its operators are thinking beyond the operating system to target lower device layers that security tools often miss because firmware is stored on the motherboard and not in the system drives uefifocused threats enable attackers to remain persistent after a system is reimaged or an infected hard drive is replaced once youve done that youve escaped the rest of the entire security stacks ability to detect says scott scheferman principal cyber strategist at eclypsium and youve gained persistence by doing that as well that you cant eradicate or even detect in most organizations  in a writeup researchers discuss what an attacker could do with this level of access trickbot operators could brick any device they find vulnerable uefi persistence could enable them to disable most oslevel security controls allowing them to resurface with no endpoint security they could land on thousands of hosts per day and learn which are vulnerable to uefi attacks there are several reasons why trickbot is moving in this direction the researchers believe the malware has become a key area of focus among defenders and security researchers notes vitali kremez ceo and chairman at advintel given this ubiquity its necessary for its operators to innovate so they can stay ahead of corporate antivirus and endpoint security products we see maturity and professionalization of the space where the criminal groups are professionals like us … they run their business as a company kremez explains its not the coding of the tool the level of attention the thought process behind a crime that makes it more interesting its the level of criminal intent — its elevated so to speak  the capabilities seen in trickboot have been demonstrated by other attackers seeking persistence in firmware researchers note whats dangerous about this discovery is trickbots spread in the last two months of infections trickbot has peaked at 40000 in one day further attackers dont need device access or a complex technique to make it work this isnt some esoteric nationstate spylevel thing says scheferman this is commodity massive widescale criminal malware that has everything it needs in tooling to know what vulnerability to hit and hit it what happens if trickboot hits recovering from an attack like this is more involved and expensive compared with traditional malware attacks the researchers report corrupted uefi firmware requires replacing or reflashing the motherboard which is more laborintensive than replacing the hard drive  a lot of times it will have hot spares for drives and memory and some of these replaceable components are more common to fail says jesse michael principal research with eclypsium but replacing the server or motherboard or an entire laptop is a much heavier issue it may have a playbook to replace a server that wont boot its less likely theyre prepared to replace several servers at the same time  the potential for this type of attack is especially concerning for operational environments where uptime is top priority scheferman adds a trickboot attack couldnt be remediated with their existing incident response playbooks and cause devastating downtime he adds while its capabilities have potential to be a significant development defenders should be cautious when attempting to determine the attackers intent without further evidence says sherrod degrippo senior director of threat research and detection at proofpoint threat actor capability does not always translate into realworld actions but network defenders should assess their capabilities to detect uefi modifications and what the implications of such attacks have on incident response and recovery she explains there are steps businesses can take to prepare before an incident strikes scheferman advises first understanding which portions of an environment are vulnerable to this type of attack gain visibility learn which devices at the firmware level may be what this module is looking for one thing to keep in mind is that a lot of enterprises dont have visibility into firmware says michael making sure firmware updates are also part of their management process and it process making sure that component is also updated is a key point of their enterprise process that they need to be aware of  while many admins prioritize patches pushed via windows update or linux firmware patches may fall by the wayside when a vendor shares them these are also generally more difficult to apply to systems he adds adding another challenge for businesses that learn they need them   recommended reading  copyright © 2020 informa plc informa uk limited is a company registered in england and wales

47,discover thomson reuters by simon lewis michael martina 6 min read reuters  republican president donald trump won election in 2016 promising to put “america first” overturn what he said were unfair trade deals and force us allies to pay more toward joint defense measures in the nov 3 election he will face off against democratic former vice president joe biden who pledges to restore us global leadership and reverse many of trump’s actions here’s a look at their foreign policy differences under trump uschina relations have slid to their lowest levels in recent history over a wide range of issues trump says he is the first president in decades to stand up to beijing and his campaign accuses biden of appeasing china as us manufacturing jobs declined biden has countered that trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic was a historic blunder and that he disregarded us intelligence community warnings over china downplaying its severity trump began a trade war with china before reaching a partial phase 1 trade deal in january he has since shut the door on phase 2 negotiations expressing unhappiness with beijing’s handling of the pandemic biden argues that china relishes a chaotic trump administration his alienation of american allies and his abdication of us leadership roles in global institutions biden says he will correct this by bringing multilateral pressure to bear on china through renewed relations with us allies trump has questioned the benefits of us military interventions in the middle east especially the 2003 iraq invasion and pulled out of a nuclear deal reached with iran european nations and russia under president barack obama but trump sent more troops to the region after the withdrawal increased tensions with iran biden has said he would deal with iran through diplomacy and reenter the agreement but only if iran first resumed complying with the deal’s restrictions on its nuclear program after iranian proxies and us forces clashed in iraq trump ordered the january strike that killed powerful iranian commander qassem soleimani biden said the strike “put the united states and iran on a collision course” and proposes a narrower focus for the us military in the region on counterterrorism and working with local allies biden wants to end us support for saudi arabia’s war in yemen which trump has defended trump met with north korea’s supreme leader kim jong un three times in 2018 and 2019 but efforts to get kim to abandon the country’s nuclear weapons program have stalled biden has accused trump of giving away us leverage over the north korean regime for little in return and said he would not meet kim without preconditions trump has said he wants a full military withdrawal from afghanistan to end america’s longest war in february the trump administration reached a deal with the taliban on phased us force reductions but it was dependent on the islamist militant group meeting conditions afghanistan and taliban negotiators held their first direct talks on sept 15 biden contends he will bring the vast majority of us troops home from afghanistan and narrowly focus the mission there on fighting al qaeda and islamic state like past presidents trump has pledged to secure peace between israel and the palestinians but as before that goal has proven elusive the administration moved the us embassy to jerusalem in 2018 a show of support for israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that angered the palestinians and their supporters the following year the administration formally recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights which israel captured from syria in 1967 reversing a longstanding us policy and irking other countries in august in a rare victory for us diplomacy in the region trump brokered a deal between israel and the united arab emirates which agreed to normalize diplomatic relations israel said it would suspend planned annexations of parts of the occupied west bank bahrain joined the uae in september in agreeing to normalize relations biden welcomed the agreements and said if elected he would “leverage these growing ties into progress toward a twostate solution” in the middle east biden would rejoin the paris climate agreement and strengthen alliances like nato moves he says would undo damage to american leadership and credibility inflicted by trump the president has angered nato members and other us allies while refusing to criticize russian leader vladimir putin even when us intelligence officials concluded russia’s military had interfered in the 2016 presidential election biden has warned that russia china and others who try to interfere in us elections will face serious consequences if he is elected trump announced in june that he would reduce the number of us troops in germany by about 9500 prompting criticism from democrats and fellow republicans who argue the usgerman alliance helps counter russia and china’s influence biden campaign aides say they are troubled by the move and that biden would revisit the issue as president reporting by simon lewis and michael martina editing by jonathan oatis our standards the thomson reuters trust principles

51,regiondetailtext persondetailtext organizationdetailtext seriesdescription  limitto140 the somali terror group al shabaab has taken credit for sunday’s bombings in the ugandan capital kampala  al shabaab has become more internationalized since early 2007 and has threatened to attack international targets but sunday’s event marks the group’s first successful attack beyond somalia’s borders al shabaab seeks al qaeda’s recognition and likely an al qaeda franchise designation currently only three such franchises exist  the group’s first international attack was likely at least partially driven by that aim al shabaab seeks to weaken the forces that hinder its expansion in and control of somalia the most notable of which is the african union mission in somalia amisom  uganda and burundi are the only two countries that contribute troops to the amisom force making their interests key targets for al shabaab al shabaab has proven on multiple occasions its ability to execute on its threats  this capacity was demonstrated again with the uganda bombings as al shabaab had threatened to strike ugandan targets on numerous occasions al shabaab’s ambitions are not limited to the continent of africa  the group has threatened the west including the us and it has numerous international militants including americans and europeans  the uganda attack should serve as a wakeup call for the entire international community somalia’s al qaedalinked terror group al shabaab claimed credit for the nearsimultaneous twin bombings that ripped through the ugandan capital of kampala on sunday july 11 killing at least 76 and injuring at least another 851  three bombings one at an ethiopian restaurant and two at a rugby club twenty minutes later targeted crowds watching the world cup soccer final2  al shabaab had made numerous threats against uganda and it has targeted ugandan troops in somalia which form much of the african union mission in somalia amisom force in the horn of africa country  sunday’s operation was the group’s first successful terror attack beyond somalia’s borders the attack demonstrates al shabaab’s capability to follow up on its threats to strike internationally and its desire to remove barriers to its control of southern and central somalia  the attack also contributes to al shabaab’s goal of receiving recognition from al qaeda al shabaab which has set up islamic administrations to govern nearly all of southern and central somalia seeks to topple somalia’s fragile transitional federal government tfg and establish an islamist state throughout the horn of africa  the group has fought tfg and amisom forces in mogadishu since it began operating as an autonomous entity in early 2007 and has managed to relegate the tfg’s authority to only a few neighborhoods inside mogadishu the capital of somalia  the group’s rhetoric and previous attacks reflect two objectives for al shabaab in helping it achieve its longterm goal of establishing an islamist state  first it seeks recognition and likely a franchise designation from al qaeda’s senior leadership  second it seeks to weaken and deter the forces in somalia hindering its expansion  the highprofile mass casualty bombings in kampala contributed to both of those objectives al shabaab has continuously sought to attract the attention of al qaeda’s central leadership since early 2008 and its first successful strike outside of somalia was likely partially driven by that aim  the group adheres to the same global islamist ideology as al qaeda and it has made numerous public statements pledging allegiance to al qaeda and praising its leaders  al shabaab’s leader mukhtar abu zubair for instance released a video in june 2008 in which he offered greetings and praise to al qaeda leaders osama bin laden ayman al zawahiri and abu yahya al libi and praised the nineteen 911 hijackers3  the group also released a video in september 2009 entitled “at your service oh osama”  voices heard throughout the video pledge loyalty to bin laden4  al shabaab reiterated its fidelity to al qaeda in february 2010 when it released the following statement “jihad in the horn of africa must be combined with the international jihad led by the al qaeda network”5  much of al shabaab’s leadership trained or fought with al qaeda in afghanistan and today its ranks include roughly 8001100 foreign fighters scores of whom have also fought in afghanistan iraq and pakistan6  the group has made a concerted effort to recruit westerners by producing englishlanguage propaganda videos and promoting americans to leadership positions  at least two dozen americans and 100 europeans have joined the group todate7  further the group has made numerous threats to strike beyond somalia’s borders including american and european targets al shabaab’s statements of allegiance to al qaeda its efforts to internationalize and success in fighting tfg forces in somalia have elicited valuable statements of support from al qaeda’s leadership  praise from leaders such as bin laden and zawahiri help establish credibility among islamists and serve as a valuable recruiting tool  al shabaab’s successful international attack will certainly earn the group praise throughout jihadi web forums and it will likely elicit some recognition from al qaeda leadership as well  more importantly al shabaab appears eager to earn a franchise designation from al qaeda  currently only three al qaeda franchises exist al qaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap al qaeda in the islamic maghreb aqim and the islamic state of iraq isi  islamist groups “bid” through both actions and words to earn the franchise designation generally bestowed on a group by zawahiri  a franchise designation serves as a valuable recruiting tool giving credibility and a known brand name to groups seeking to attract aspiring islamist militants  it also gives the groups access to al qaeda resources including fundraising and financial support however limited that may be at the present time no publicly available official criteria exists detailing the requirements to become an al qaeda franchise but contributing to al qaeda’s overall goals including the establishment of an islamic caliphate the expulsion of perceived infidels from islamic lands and the targeting of us interests appear to have helped the three current franchises receive their designations  the isi for instance earned its designation for fighting american forces in iraq which al qaeda then perceived to be the primary front against the west  aqim gained its status in part by providing militants to the isi was led by veterans of the fighting in afghanistan and grew out of militant islamist groups that had maintained an active insurgency against the algerian government for over a decade at the time of its receipt of franchise status  aqap’s top leadership had all fought in afghanistan or iraq its leader was even the personal assistant to bin laden  further aqap had launched attacks to destabilize the perceived infidel yemeni and later saudi regime al shabaab’s “bid” for a franchise designation has included numerous statements of allegiance to al qaeda the establishment of islamic administrations which is only one step shy of the establishment of an islamist state and a sustained effort to drive perceived infidel invaders out of somalia  al shabaab has enhanced its “bid” by proving its ability to conduct a mass casualty attack outside of somalia thus increasing the confidence al qaeda’s central leadership may have in the group’s capabilities  moreover the attack targeted an ally of the united states and a government with troops in a muslim country  the importance of somalia as a central front for the fight against the west has not been lost on bin laden  the al qaeda leader released only five statements in 2009 and he dedicated one of them entirely to the situation in somalia saying “the war taking place in somalia…is a war between islam and the international crusade”8       al shabaab has long identified uganda as a target  the group has killed at least a dozen ugandan soldiers in mogadishu since the start of 2010 using suicide bombs roadside improvised explosive devices and mortar attacks  uganda initially deployed 1700 troops to somalia in march 2007 to support the new amisom mission there9  currently uganda contributes about half of the 6100soldier strong amisom force burundi supplies the remainder and a ugandan officer major general nathan mugisha commands the force10  uganda also serves as a training site for somali tfg troops  the european union has already trained at least 600 somali troops in western uganda and it plans on training at least another 1400 there11  additionally uganda’s amisom forces receive training equipment and logistical support from the united states12    the current amisom mandate stipulates that its forces support the tfg and defend important government infrastructure allowing its troops to only engage in defensive peacekeeping operations13  ugandan and burundi troops do not have the mandate to go on the offensive against al shabaab and therefore remain stationary at their strategic posts throughout mogadishu including near the presidential villa the airport and seaport while al shabaab fires on them at will  amisom forces have a history of responding to such attacks by returning fire indiscriminately occasionally leading to civilian casualties  ugandan military officials have attempted to remedy this situation by lobbying to expand the amisom mandate and calling for a significant increase in the number of amisom troops on the ground in mogadishu14  the ugandan amisom commander for instance has said that he needs 20000 troops to maintain peace in somalia and uganda’s deputy foreign minister okello oryem said as recently as last week that uganda will send more troops to somalia but only if the amisom mandate changes so that the troops can go on the offensive against al shabaab15  the ugandans’ efforts however have been to no avail    al shabaab’s selection of its first international target was wellthought out and meticulously timed  the group’s primary objective was to influence the ugandan policy of support for amisom and to provoke uganda to withdraw its troops  an al shabaab spokesman sheikh ali mohamud rage took credit for the attack by stating “we thank the mujahideen that carried out the attack we are sending a message to uganda and burundi if they do not take out their amisom troops from somalia blasts will continue”16   the current government of uganda led by president yoweri museveni has remained steadfast in its dedication to amisom  museveni for instance called on the international community to support an expanded amisom mandate just one week after the september 2009 al shabaab bombing of the amisom headquarters17  ugandan military officials have likewise pledged on several occasions since then that ugandan troops would remain in somalia until militants are eradicated and peace is restored18  deputy foreign minister oryem reiterated that pledge just hours after sunday’s bombings “ugandans are not cowards and we are not going to run away from mogadishu just because of this cowardly act”19  uganda however is scheduled to hold a presidential election in 2011 and the leading opposition candidate kizza besigye has long called for the withdrawal of ugandan troops from somalia20  a highprofile terror attack has the potential to alter public opinion  al shabaab may have sought to capitalize on such an opportunity in an effort to influence the upcoming ugandan elections in a way that may help it achieve its longterm goals    the upcoming annual african union summit which kampala will host from july 19 to july 27 likely played a role in al shabaab’s timing and target of the attack as well  the expansion of the amisom mandate will almost certainly be on the summit’s agenda  notably the intergovernmental authority on development igad a bloc of six east african countries decided on july 5 that it would seek to deploy an additional 2000 troops to support amisom which would bring the total number of troops in the force to the 8100troop level called for in the mandate21  further igad agreed to work with the african union and the un security council to increase the total number of troops in somalia to 2000022  al shabaab ideologically opposes soccer and has banned the playing and watching of the sport so its decision to specifically target world cup fans may have reinforced that ideology but the potential for mass casualties was likely the driving force for selecting the specific targets inside uganda  ugandan police in fact have announced that they discovered an unexploded suicide vest at a local discotheque suggesting that the group’s opposition to soccer had a minimal impact on the selection of targets23  the bombings took place at venues reportedly frequented by expatriates and at least one american died in the attack  al shabaab however seemed more concerned with killing ugandans than westerners as revealed by its statement released the day after the attack “these attacks have killed close to 100 people  mostly ugandans  who were having fun at those locations…the ugandan people are experiencing the beginning of what they have been warned about”24 al shabaab issued a string of threats against uganda and burundi in the days leading up to sunday’s attacks  the group’s spiritual leader and main spokesman sheikh mukhtar robow ali who is believed to have trained in afghanistan and set up the first militant training camps in somalia reportedly called on followers at friday prayers last week to attack sites in uganda and burundi25  he also told a group of supporters on july 5 we tell the muslim youths and mujahideen wherever they are in the muslim world to attack explode and burn the embassies of burundi and uganda26  al shabaab’s leader mukhtar abu zubair issued a similar statement on somali airwaves on july 5 threatening the people of uganda and burundi you should know that the massacres against the children women and the elderly of mogadishu will be revenged against you keep in mind that revenge for the aggressions being committed by your leaders and soldiers is awaiting you we have to carry out an allout jihad campaign against the enemy and everyone should take part both young and old that is the only way to end the massacres being carried out by the infidels in our country against the weak among us27 al shabaab also released an englishlanguage video through its media arm al kataib on june 27 that called on the ugandan and burundi “crusaders” to leave somalia and advised the “mujahideen to make the ugandans their top priority”28    the volume of al shabaab threats directed at uganda increased in the past two weeks but the group has been threatening to strike ugandan interests including inside uganda for over two years  al shabaab issued a lengthy statement on january 3 2008 in which it warned that the same destruction caused by “the alliance of ethiopia uganda and burundi” in mogadishu would be reciprocated by al shabaab in those countries’ capitals29  the group also specifically threatened the capitals of burundi and uganda in an october 2009 statement by a senior commander “we shall make their people cry we’ll attack bujumbura and kampala we will move our fighting to those two cities and we shall destroy them”30               it should come as no surprise that al shabaab managed to follow through on its threats against uganda  the group is perhaps more adept than any terror group in the world at executing on its threats  it conducted twin suicide bombings on september 17 2009 at the african union headquarters in mogadishu for instance less than a week after it vowed to avenge the death of al qaeda in east africa leader saleh ali nabhan31  similarly the group attacked a college graduation ceremony in december 2009 killing around 20 graduates and the minister of education just three months after it warned the ministry of education about using unislamic textbooks32  al shabaab has also followed through on several threats made against nongovernmental organizations operating inside somalia including the world food program and the un mine action service33  abu mansour al amriki an american commander in al shabaab stated in january 2008 that “al shabaab had a global goal including the establishment of the islamic caliphate in all parts of the world”34  the group has steadily become more internationalized since then increasing the number of foreign fighters in its ranks making international threats and even establishing a brigade whose sole purpose is to liberate islamic holy places around the world  the bombings in uganda confirmed al shabaab’s desire to strike its enemies beyond somalia’s borders and proved its ability to do so  sunday’s attacks must serve as a warning to the west  al shabaab controls vast swaths of territory – more than any islamist group in the world – where it can plan and train for attacks  it has many militants with experience fighting in war zones and dozens with american and european passports  uganda is separated by one country from somalia and kampala sits nearly 600 miles from somalia’s closest border  sunday’s attack was not merely a crossborder raid but rather a highly coordinated and sophisticated international attack  al shabaab’s ambitions are not limited to the african continent and western policymakers cannot afford to make the costly mistake of dismissing the group as merely a regional threat  the group has made clear on several occasions its desire to strike the united states perhaps most boldly in a june 2008 message from its leader  so wait oh cursed america for the events of the coming september ie the next major attacks for it is not a strike but strikes they conspired against us and made us retarded economically and politically and sic and technologically and religiously and morally and even mentally and all of these tragedies are caused by the mother of all evil america it continues and america did not learn sufficiently from the previous strikes the curses of allah are upon america and those who are loyal to it or protect it or love it35  al shabaab has proven time and time again its ability to execute on threats in somalia and now it has also proven its ability to execute on threats internationally  the group will continue to seek recognition and support from al qaeda and will attempt to ascend to a position of prominence within the islamist community  al shabaab operates with relative impunity in southern and central somalia  uganda’s decision in the coming year along with that of other african nations on whether or not to fight al shabaab will be significant for the peace and stability of the

from terrorism and specific methods of attack are evolving and increasing in sophistication there is a high threat of kidnapping throughout the country travel by road throughout the country but particularly outside the capital kabul is extremely dangerous seek professional security advice for all travel and consider using armoured vehicles despite all the enthusiasm for the afghan national army during the nato drawdown they are clearly not up to the job lack of discipline poor leadership and widespread corruption have neutered the effectiveness of afghanistan’s own forces now nato the us and the uk are all considering sending more troops ostensibly still to train and advise but recent us actions against isisk in afghanistan demonstrate that once again this is turning into a combat scenario serious questions must now be raised concerning current military strategy in world war ii the allies defeated nazi germany – a far superior military power than the taliban – in six years and

weeks and this was her first group meeting of embassy staff—but only the women the room was hushed as she entered in pants and a black and white jacket without the customary headscarf worn in male company she stopped short of the podium and sat on a set of steps eye to eye with her employees “today it’s just the women” she said “it is our day to celebrate”  earlier that day the saudi government had announced it was relaxing the country’s socalled guardianship system a mixture of laws and customs requiring women to get permission from men in their families to make all manner of personal decisions the ambassador talked the women through their new rights including obtaining passports and traveling abroad registering marriages filing for divorce and serving as legal guardians for children despite her royal status the princess explained that as a divorced mother she was only now the head of her own household “you have unalienable rights now” she told the women “the right to your own identity to move dream work” but the new freedoms she cautioned came with new responsibilities “know where your money is” she told them be “gracious” to saudi men who have no user manual to navigate this new world “we are going to have to have a very emotional learning curve on what we are now allowed to do” she said it was a historic moment both for saudi arabia and for its embassy princess reema is now the first woman to serve as saudi ambassador to any country she was already something of a celebrity back home in riyadh having agitated for saudi women to enjoy the same rights and freedoms she experienced growing up in washington where her father prince bandar bin sultan served as ambassador from 1983 to 2005 now many saudis see her as a symbol to the united states of crown prince mohammed bin salman’s ambitious plan to modernize saudi society and a personification of the new possibilities available to saudi women  yet it is unclear how much even a reformminded usraised daughter of a diplomat can do for the saudis in washington right now princess reema 44 arrives at a time of deep distrust between the united states and saudi arabia—and in particular the crown prince who is considered the power behind the throne of his father king salman the saudiled war in yemen the government’s detention of activists and dissenters and the us intelligence community’s assessment that the crown prince himself ordered the brutal killing of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi have left official washington perhaps more skeptical than ever of the us alliance with riyadh “she is stepping into this job when it is probably the toughest time for a saudi ambassador” says elisa massimino the former ceo of human rights first and now a professor at georgetown law center “it’s not just because of khashoggi but a bipartisan effort to recalibrate the entire ussaudi relationship” in her first interview since arriving in washington the ambassador was well aware that neither her résumé nor her history of advocacy on behalf of women will easily change the perception among saudi arabia’s critics that her appointment is simply a public relations stunt to distract from widespread concerns over the crown prince also known as mbs “everyone has the right to their own opinion and i would like to be judged on the quality of my work” she told me in september in her spacious top floor office “i am not here with bubble wrap and i would be offended if i was treated with kid gloves” she likely won’t be while the princess might be a revolutionary in some respects she represents—and fiercely defends—a regime that many in washington associate more closely with horrific human rights abuses the ambassador in spite of her own record of pushing for women’s rights downplays mbs’ detention of several dozen women activists she also told me she “never had a shadow of a doubt” about the crown prince’s professed innocence in the khashoggi death in spite of the cia’s conclusion to the contrary in a pair of recent television interviews marking the oneyear anniversary of the murder mbs took responsibility as saudi arabia’s de facto ruler but continued to deny being personally involved  princess reema bint bandar al saud shown on at the embassy in washington is the first woman to serve as saudi ambassador to the united states representing a country where women have long had fewer rights than men one of her predecessors is her father bandar bin sultan al saud whose picture hangs in the embassy at the end of the top row of frames above  allison shelley for politico magazine in washington princess reema like her predecessors has been meeting with lawmakers and administration officials while launching a new broader effort to bridge the cultural divide between america and saudi arabia with a west coast trip in her first few weeks on the job but saudi critics on capitol hill are already signaling their skepticism that the princess no matter her intentions can have much sway because of the government she represents “the ambassador is undoubtedly impressive” says senator chris murphy of connecticut who has met with her “but i don’t know how much that matters if the policy she is explaining is completely backwards and contrary to our country’s national security interests” there are also questions about her influence given that the crown prince has a direct line to jared kushner president donald trump’s soninlaw and special adviser who is attending a major economic summit in riyadh this week one senior us administration official who knows princess reema and asked to remain anonymous to speak candidly about her calls her a “serious person” who could make inroads with lawmakers and other officials—the trump administration after all has steadfastly defended the saudis—and could soften riyadh’s reputation “her job is clear which is to erase some of the negative view people have of the kingdom” says karen elliott house author of on saudi arabia its people past religion fault lines and future “and she is a good choice to do that she is not just a princess and a woman she is a dedicated and driven single mother she actually has a lot in common with the american woman” still anyone looking for a winkwink or private eye roll suggesting that the princess harbors doubts about her boss will be disillusioned she says she is a “true believer” in mbs’ vision for reforming and advancing saudi arabia and she wants americans to see that vision too  “my job is to clarify that narrative” the ambassador says “my job is to hear the tone here understand the sentiment and convey it back home”  reema bint bandar al saud is about as royal as one can get in the kingdom of saudi arabia her father prince bandar is the grandson of the late king abdulaziz and her mother princess haifa bint faisal is the daughter of the late king faisal abdulaziz’s third son that makes reema a direct descendant of abdulaziz also known as ibn saud—the founder of modern saudi arabia—on both sides of the family but princess reema who was 7 years old when her family moved to washington for her father’s posting had as much of an american upbringing as a saudi one raised in the muslim faith she and her seven siblings grew up eating betty crocker mcdonald’s and buckets of kfc she says weekends were spent as a family—movies on saturdays followed by pizza hut or chinese food at peking gourmet where her father’s picture still hangs on the wall sundays were for barbecue and watching football at the family farmhouse in maryland she was trailed by a security detail as a kid but she says “we weren’t raised to be little royals” she insists her father one of the most powerful and wellconnected diplomats in washington “made life as normal as possible”  the princess—shown here with her family at their home in mclean virginia in 1983—insists her father one of the most powerful and wellconnected diplomats in washington “made life as normal as possible”  courtesy of the al saud family after earning a degree in museum studies from the george washington university in 1999 reema initially pursued a career in the art world—and soon began running up against saudi social customs for women in 2008 she returned to riyadh with plans to oversee portions of her mother’s islamic art collection that were about to go on display at the saudi national museum but the museum refused to employ a woman her family which has a more progressive reputation on women’s issues in saudi arabia instead donated the art to a women’s financial literacy organization launched by reema’s grandmother queen iffat reema also coowned the first womenonly gym and day spa in riyadh when she and two cousins opened it saudi regulations limited women to owning only one type of business—seamstress shops—so they set aside one room for a seamstress and a sewing machine with the rest of the spa intact “i didn’t grow up with the rigidity of saudi society … when i came back and said ‘i want to do 1 2 or 3’ and the law didn’t say ‘no’ i just did it” the princess says “i appeared to be overstepping and pushing boundaries but i didn’t have those boundaries in my head i felt comfortable and morally correct” by 2010 reema had become the first female ceo of a major retail company in saudi arabia taking over the riyadh branch of harvey nichols whose parent company is owned by her family within a few months king abdullah the current king’s predecessor issued a decree requiring stores to hire female staff in women’s departments the princess seeing an opportunity ousted several dozen seasoned salesmen provided child care and transportation for her new female employees and helped them open their own bank accounts to deposit their salaries she says telling them “the money that you make is yours” it was a radical social experiment in a country where women traditionally didn’t interact with men except relatives outside the home profits fell the saudi religious police regularly shut down the store for not following guidelines curtailing women’s interaction with men but reema appealed the closures with the ministry of labor and would be up and running again “a royal may have more courage than the average person to push the boundaries but in the kingdom people are increasingly making their own change by doing what they want to do and getting away with it” explains elliott house “it’s easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission yes that’s an american phrase but it is a saudi practice”  after returning to saudi arabia princess reema—shown above at a 2018 economic conference in riyadh and below at a girls’ soccer tournament in new york this fall—launched a career as a businesswoman working to help other saudi women enter the workforce too  top saudi press agency bottom minsk in 2013 after an amicable divorce from prince faisal bin turki with whom she has two children reema founded alf khair an organization to provide guidance for saudi women entering the workforce through the same organization she began advocating for breast cancer awareness “it was scandalous” she recalls—even the word “breast” is taboo in saudi arabia as is the idea of selfexams—but the saudi government backed the public health campaign her work attracted the attention of the head of the saudi general sports authority which promotes sports and physical fitness and in 2016 the princess became the gsa’s first female deputy director of planning and development and vice president of women’s affairs in her first year she says she worked from home to avoid an inhospitable environment for women when she finally started showing up at the office men wouldn’t get in the elevator with her for months that year the crown prince tasked all government agencies with finding ways to improve quality of life in saudi arabia princess reema worked to implement a plan for physical education in girls schools the licensing of female gyms and the use of public spaces for women to play sports alongside men “she fought with about five or six ministries for some of these changes and spoke her mind without people feeling threatened” says fawaz farooqui a male colleague at the time “she just kept showing up and speaking to all levels of government respectfully and changed the mind of these government employees one by one until they said ‘ok’” during one allhands meeting the chairman of the quality of life initiative asked the department heads about obstacles they faced the princess raised her hand “it was a roomful of men” she recalls “i said ‘if women have to keep asking for permission of a man to engage in all of these wonderful things this isn’t going to be achievable and if women cannot drive themselves or get themselves to participate in any of this it’s not going to happen and so what would it look like if these two major obstacles could go away’” she was concerned she might have overstepped until a few weeks later when she was appointed as head of a new committee to reduce obstacles to women’s engagement in society king salman soon issued a royal decree to identify these obstacles about two years later he announced saudi women would finally be allowed to drive around the same time the regime now largely under mbs’ direction began cracking down on female dissenters including jailing several dozen women activists who pushed for the right to drive and fought against the guardianship system reema even as she had pushed for gender equality saw the global reaction to the imprisonments as overblown she notes that most of the women have been released several however are still in detention one of whom amnesty international alleges has been tortured in prison the saudi government denies this the princess believes that the detained women broke the law by campaigning publicly rather than privately for those new rights and that reforms—including the rollbacks to the guardianship system announced this past summer—were already on their way  in recent years saudi arabia has granted women the right to drive and relaxed its “guardianship” system by finally allowing women to travel abroad register marriages and divorces and become their children’s guardians without first getting permission from men in their families  getty images she stepped forward to defend the kingdom insisting that the west was viewing saudi arabia’s transformation unfairly “you ask us to change and then when we exhibit change you come to us with cynicism” she told the audience at the world economic forum in 2018 “we’re not doing gender equality because the west wants it or because it will target human rights watch and get them off our backs or because amnesty international is going to say ‘great good job’ we’re doing it because it is right” “it really did make her a rock star in saudi” recalls may aldayel the daughter of a saudi diplomat who grew up in the united states with the princess and remains a close friend “she said what everyone wanted to say which is that we are trying to change at our own pace” but the contradiction between reema’s own advocacy and her defense of mbs was not lost on some observers “there are women who were pushing for the right to participate in elections to drive to gain control over their own lives who are now in jail” says kristin diwan a senior resident scholar at the arab gulf states institute who has written about gender in saudi arabia “they took risks to advance the very agenda mbs is now pursuing i think it’s completely legitimate to challenge the princess on why this is taking place” “she will be a great example of the public roles now entrusted to saudi women” diwan adds “but she will also serve as a constant reminder of those women reformers who remain imprisoned”  in 2017 reema was sent to washington ahead of the crown prince’s multicity tour of the united states mbs’ brother khalid bin salman the ambassador to the united states at the time was expected to take a leadership position back home in the future and reema was being whispered about as his possible replacement the royal court had assigned her to several highlevel working groups and committees dealing with the ussaudi relationship “she came across as a dynamic personality” recalls wendy chamberlin thenpresident of the middle east institute which hosted the princess for lunch at its headquarters in washington “she knows washington she speaks washington she is someone we can relate to” but now chamberlin quickly adds “the outrage over jamal khashoggi’s brutal murder runs deep and this is not something that can be easily fixed” young saudis refer to a time “before jk” and “after jk” before jamal khashoggi—a journalist and former adviser to the royal family who became a critic of mbs—was murdered inside the saudi consulate in istanbul on october 2 2018 the west cheered the crown prince’s plans for social and economic transformation but as details emerged about khashoggi’s brutal killing—at the hands the cia determined of members of mbs’ inner circle and with his knowledge—the country faced an uncertainty similar to after september 11 2001 when most of the hijackers responsible for the attacks were found to be saudi trump refused to acknowledge the cia’s conclusion about mbs’ involvement but much of the rest of washington including some of the president’s political allies was enraged reema whose family was close to members of the prominent khashoggi clan saw the murder as both a personal tragedy and a professional landmine “i was mourning the loss of this man’s life on a personal level and i was mourning what could have been the end of our vision” she says “what he wrote about was everything positive the kingdom could be … out of respect for him someone to me who was like family i would hope people wouldn’t use his death to hold 11 million young people hostage” attempts to reach khashoggi’s family for comment were unsuccessful  under the de facto leadership of crown prince mohammed bin salman—at bottom left with his father king salman—saudi arabia has faced intense criticism over the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi at the saudi consulate in istanbul in 2018 as well as the detention of activists and dissidents  getty images ap reema firmly stood by mbs’ assertion that he did not order the killing even after the cia determined with “medium to high confidence” that he did “i had at that point spent enough time with the crown prince to know this is not his mo” she says “this is not how he operates and this is something that would destroy everything he has dreamt of and i could not in my life imagine that he would ask for this to be done” pressed for an explanation she says it’s possible people around mbs committed the murder without checking with him thinking they were solving a problem after the killing prince khalid was effectively persona non grata in washington and quickly returned to riyadh and in february mbs appointed reema as the successor—a decision met in washington with a mix of skepticism and intrigue in july she started the job once held by her father moving into the same house in mclean virginia where she grew up at her father’s suggestion she asked for advice from some of his former colleagues and friends including former secretary of state colin powell who was close to prince bandar when he served in washington she readily admits her father leaves big shoes to fill he was a towering figure in saudi diplomacy—charming talented and close to both the saudi king and the upper echelons of washington society particularly the bush family earning him the nickname “bandar bush” “bandar’s skill was very much behind the curtain very private” says richard murphy who served as us ambassador to saudi arabia and a top state department diplomat during bandar’s era “the kind of access he had to the administration was unparalleled” bandar still visits washington periodically from the region and unlike some other members of the royal family remains in the good graces of the current saudi government princess reema’s approach to the job so far has been more public and focused more broadly than her predecessors’ while her immediate task is to nurture the political alliance between washington and riyadh as her father did she says her instinct is to work more on what she calls the “soft side of social change” she wants the ussaudi story to no longer focus just on counterterrorism or oil talking instead of a “comprehensive partnership” in business culture and education she is also trying to portray saudi arabia as a more tolerant society too and recently sent the embassy’s jewish contacts a greeting for rosh hashanah  as ambassador prince bandar was close to both the saudi king and the upper echelons of washington society particularly the bush family earning him the nickname “bandar bush”  ap getty images over the summer the princess traveled to los angeles to host a “sports diplomacy workshop” in a hotel ballroom she introduced a handful of american agents and former athletes to neom a new 500 billion city on saudi arabia’s northwestern coast that seeks to compete with neighboring dubai as a tourist destination and sports training hub the athletes were enthusiastic as were executives she visited at space x with whom she hopes to work to help develop the saudi space industry there was more of a mixed reception among the hollywood executives she met who are still concerned about the optics of doing business in the kingdom in new york a month later between meetings with world leaders at the united nations general assembly the princess attended the playoffs of the global girls world cup when she arrived to cheer on the female saudi soccer club which she had helped form in riyadh she was mobbed for selfies to skeptics—and saudi arabia has many—it will take more than these kinds of efforts to soften the kingdom’s image in congress and among the american public many washington insiders still see both mbs’ reform agenda and the appointment of the first female saudi ambassador as an effort to paper over the crown prince’s repression at home and abroad in the past two years mbs has overseen not only the roundup of female activists but also the detention of intellectuals who disagree with his policies and of lebanese prime minister saad hariri as well as the imprisonment—and allegedly in some cases torture—of 200 prominent businessmen former officials and princes at the ritzcarlton in riyadh in what he presented as an anticorruption effort but which human rights group said was meant to reclaim assets for the kingdom “at the same time they are touting their bona fides as reformers they have gone around the world to round up saudi dissidents in a way that has never happened before” says murphy one of the senate’s lead backers of legislation earlier this year to block the trump administration’s arms sales to saudi arabia which the president vetoed “at the same time they are getting credit for allowing women to drive they are putting women political activists in jail in a way they never did before the crown prince was in charge” princess reema’s government also has been criticized for thousands of civilian casualties in the saudiled war on yemen and for creating what the united nations says is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis the princess who has been meeting with us officials about the issue both understands and rejects these criticisms “the united states doesn’t have a border with yemen and you aren’t being attacked day in and day out with missiles over your borders” she says referring to crossborder attacks by iranaligned houthi rebels in yemen earlier this month the trump administration announced it was sending 3000 us troops to bolster saudi defenses   princess reema is focusing on what she calls the “soft side of social change”—business culture and education but to skeptics of saudi arabia these efforts aren’t enough to erase the stain left by the crown prince’s repression at home and abroad  allison shelley for politico magazine jon alterman vice president and middle east director at the center for strategic and international studies says that on these and other policy matters princess reema’s effectiveness will be limited as long as the relationship with the us is personalized as being about mbs and not about saudi arabia “identifying change in saudi arabia with the crown prince is going to inhibit many individuals and organizations from affiliating closely with saudi arabia and that is what she is trying to overcome” he says “that’s going to take time” so far several senior us officials say they have found reema to be wellconnected with the government in riyadh including the crown prince despite his reputation for having few confidants for her part she says “i have never felt more respected and more heard from my leadership than i do right now” adding of mbs “the cloud he is swimming in is profoundly unfair” while that loyalty to mbs turns off many in washington the senior us administration official says it could also be the princess’ key to gaining the influence she needs with the crown prince to advance her own social agenda “reema is one of the few people who can potentially try to sway him” the official says “there is an absence of figures in the saudi system who can reorient him and push in a different direction from doing things that are bad she is energetic she knows more needs to be done i have faith she will be a good asset”  california   by jeremy b white   updated 050820 0944 pm edt   by sam sutton and carly sitrin    by bill mahoney and

190,a clear divide has emerged in the afghan government on the role of war victims in the peace process in a surprising move president ashraf ghani recently suggested that afghanistan should follow the spanish model – better known as the ‘pact of forgetting’ meanwhile the ministry of peace and members of the afghan negotiating team have been quietly creating the first rudimentary structures to start including victims’ representation and consultation their efforts fall well short of proposals from three victims and human rights groups but may offer a glimmer of hope to victims aan’s ehsan qaane has been looking at three proposals for a victimcentred peace process the changed language of victims’ rights groups as well as a long line of potential spoilers from former mujahedin leaders and others in the afghan government to the taleban and the united states    facing the past mass grave on kabuls tapaye shuhadaye danayi martyrs of knowledge hill a memorial for the 40 students killed in an attack on an education centre nearby in august 2018 the message on one of the placards reads who is representing victims in peace negotiations photo hadi morawejahrdo views on the ongoing peace talks  war victims’ groups in afghanistan and human rights institutions have long supported the notion of a peace process based on the concept of inclusivity and justice they argue that inclusion which would improve prospects for a lasting peace is an essential right of victims as well as an integral part of any peace talks ever since the united states made clear its sole focus was to withdraw through a ‘peace deal’ and with the afghan government and the taleban now starting their own peace talks calls for a victimcentred peace process have grown so far however there’s little sign that the warring parties are listening   on the opening day of the intraafghan talks on 12 september the afghanistan independent human rights commission aihrc released a press statement welcoming the start of the talks which it described as “a unique opportunity to end the war and suffering in the country” the aihrc called for “recognition of the expressed wishes of victims” to be “the heart of the deliberations” 1 two days later on 14 september 2020 a symbolic gathering of around 100 survivors and relatives of victims of war was held at a mass grave for 40 students killed in an attack on the mawud education centre in kabul in august 2018 the mass grave is named tapaye shuhadaye danayi martyrs of knowledge hill to honour the students who were massacred the gathering was organised by the national victimscentred peace network which released a resolution in which it described the peace talks as a “historic opportunity to achieve a just victimcentred and sustainable peace” and encouraged the negotiating teams to take the best interests of the nation and victims’ demands into account at the negotiation table see annex for the full text of the resolution 2  victims’ rights activists have been at pains to remind participants in the peace talks that victims should be recognised as a significant constituency in afghanistan the transitional justice coordination group tjcg a coalition of 26 individuals and organisations including victims’ groups argue that since victims form “one of the largest constituencies in the country” the talks should reflect that in a position paper released earlier this year the group cited the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan unama’s reporting which shows that more than 35000 civilians have been killed and 66000 wounded since they began to systematically collate civilian casualties in 2009   demands and expectations  the three organisations mentioned above the national victimscentred peace network the aihrc and the tjcg have all put forward position papers or recommendations about victims’ representation in the ongoing peace talks with some differences in the detail the positions taken by these entities are broadly alike there are a range of overlapping mechanisms proposed including direct testimony from victims to parties to the conflict aihrc and tjcg a national victims’ consultative jirga aihrc and a committee representing victims who would be a formal part of the peace talks victims’ network and tjcg   a aihrc’s proposals  in june 2020 the aihrc published a paper on the inclusion and rights of victims in the peace talks the paper lays out four mechanisms two of which relate to victims’ direct participation   victims’ testimonies a group of victims “from across the country and of a variety of types of violence” should have the opportunity “to speak directly to the parties about their experience in the conflict” these victims should be selected “through independent and impartial bodies agreed by the warring bodies”  national victims’ consultative jirga and outreach a consultative jirga would “discuss issues of victims justice and reconciliation” to respond to “initial outcomes” of the peace talks the assembly should not have decisionmaking powers prior to the jirga the parties to the conflict should engage in outreach with victims inviting online submissions and consultations facilitated by civil societysocial networks  in addition to these two proposals the aihrc recommended two other means through which victims’ interests could be furthered through wider civil society inputs rather than victims per se first would be a subcommittee which would consult regularly with both sides involved in the negotiations second avenues for written proposals should be shared with the negotiating parties   b national victimscentred peace network’s proposals  the victims’ network called on the negotiating teams to create a formal mechanism to directly include victims in the talks in a 14 september resolution   joint special victims’ committee this should be created by both parties to the conflict as a key part of the negotiation process “to follow up on the basic demands of victims and their families” the committee should establish and introduce a “welldefined mechanism of access and communication with victims”  in addition the victims’ network would establish a secretariat which would also communicate with negotiating teams on behalf of members of their network  c transitional justice coordination group’s proposals  tjcg’s paper provides case studies from other countries including colombia to argue that in places where victims have directly participated in talks a more durable peace has been established based on this argument tjcg proposes the following mechanisms   representation in all peace institutions this means victims should be included as members of the negotiating delegations and the high council for national reconciliation hcnr  technical committee this should be established within the hcnr to provide advice to the victims’ representatives in the negotiating delegations  victims’ testimony not dissimilar from the aihrc proposal the tjcg proposes that victims that have “substantive engagement” with “negotiating delegates and primary conflict actors” the paper says that victims’ testimony can have a “transformative impact on peace negotiators and victims alike” citing columbia as an example where such a process changed views of both victims and conflict actors for those involved and the wider public  now that talks have started without these elements in place some of these proposals may seem less likely to be taken on board however the talks are still at a preliminary stage with many modalities yet to be finalised also as will be discussed later the government is still working out its own policy on victims’ inclusion   new terms to bring victims back into the spotlight  victims of war and other forms of conflict have been marginalised for many years as a political force in afghanistan in an attempt to reboot their demands there has been a noticeable shift in the language being used by victims’ advocates with ‘victimcentred peace’ and ‘victimcentred justice’ replacing the term ‘transitional justice’ when talking about the inclusion of victims of war in the peace talks since 2001 transitional justice was the preferred term for tackling victims’ wishes and dealing with past atrocities at least among victims’ groups human rights activists and the media but in the last two years discussions among victims’ rights and human rights advocates have brought consensus on alternative terms for transitional justice the author participated in some of these discussions  there are two reasons for the shift firstly ‘transitional justice’ – adalate enteqali or enteqali adalat in persian and pashto – as a term is not widely understood in english its meaning is also not obvious per se but its wide use means it has come to be understood usually transitional justice is defined as a set of processes and mechanisms including truth finding reparations and criminal justice which ensure there is justice during a transition from war to peace or from an authoritarian to a democratic government in dari and pashto the two official languages in afghanistan the exact translation of ‘transitional’ has given us adalate enteqali or enteqali adalat but enteqal usually refers to a physical movement often afghans assume it refers to physically moving justice from one place to another   secondly the shift to new terms reflects a pragmatic distancing from the negative connotations that transitional justice has gained in afghanistan opponents of transitional justice have deliberately attempted to identify it exclusively with criminal justice with those who fear being accused as war criminals inciting their followers to stand against taking any action to do with dealing with past wrong after the transition to a posttaleban administration in 2001   an apparent conflict between peace and stability on the one hand and justice on the other has been posited as far back as the bonn conference in december 2001 with the argument that justice had to be sacrificed to stability important players at bonn particularly those representing the mujahedin factions but also the us took this position and it was backed by the united nations chair of the conference lakhdar brahimi 3 the conference helped set a course where the interests of political factions and shortterm stability were deliberately and explicitly prioritised over justice for detail on this see aan’s major report on transitional justice from page 14 onwards 18 years later there has been no accountability for any war crimes including mass atrocities yet nor has there been peace many have argued that ignoring justice was one factor fermenting instability    in 2005 the aihrc released its report “a call for justice” the findings of its national consultation with victims of pre2001 war crimes also in 2005 the afghan government published its threeyear transitional justice “national action plan for peace reconciliation and justice” but was unable to implement it in the face of political opposition mujahedin leaders from the main civil war factions organised a large gathering in kabul where they invited their followers and former fighters to rally against the government’s plans thousands of people gathered in the ghazi soccer stadium where transitional justice was labelled a ‘foreigners’ policy’ against the mujahedin designed to put them behind bars this narrative which ignored the restorative component of transitional justice has been consistently aired on some of these mujahedin leaders’ private tv channels over many years subsequently the afghan parliament with its high proportion of former mujahedin leaders and commanders among its members approved an ‘amnesty law’ in 2007 which gave a blanket amnesty to those involved in wars before 2001 and a conditional amnesty to those who continued to fight in the post2001 era if they reconciled with the government 4  reducing transitional justice to only criminal justice has had two implications firstly it shifts focus from the victims to the perpetrators holding perpetrators accountable is indeed an essential part of transitional justice but finding the truth healing wounds compensating victims’ losses and bringing institutional reform are also core elements of the process these components were addressed in the government’s national action plan but were lost in the noise of the former warlords’ criminal justice narrative secondly it created an unnecessary fear among those who had been involved in the conflict – including lowranking fighters – that if transitional justice were implemented they would be put behind bars to the extent that transitional justice has an accountability component the focus is generally on command responsibility rather than fighters but this was lost   this narrative helped to divide society between those who believed that the past should be left alone and those who longed for justice the proponents for justice failed to create a sufficient political and social constituency for their cause while the opponents succeeded in derailing the implementation of the transitional justice national action plan and control large parts of the victims’ constituency that is divided along political and ethnic lines this was particularly true under the leadership of the former president hamed karzai who was significantly influenced by former mujahedin leaders including several alleged war criminals when ashraf ghani his successor was first campaigning for the presidency in 2013 it was hoped that he would distance his administration from people implicated in potential war crimes and publish the aihrc’s conflict mapping report as he promised during his campaign however his selection of general now marshall abdul rashid dostum as vice president – albeit on condition of a halfhearted public apology – swiftly diminished such hopes   today the tendency to equate transitional justice with criminal justice is still a dominant narrative which discourages the warring parties from involving victims in the ongoing peace talks human rights institutions and victims’ groups are hoping that by using ‘victimcentred peace’ and ‘victimcentred justice’ as alternative terms they can bring back the focus to victims’ needs and their potential to make a positive contribution to peace   the afghan government’s position  the afghan government still seems to be formulating its policy on the inclusion of victims in the intraafghan peace talks within the recently constituted state ministry of peace however hostility from presidential and vicepresidential offices risks undermining more positive intentions at lower levels of government   in a blow to victims president ghani made perhaps his most clear statement yet against a victimcentred peace process speaking at a ceremony in the palace to celebrate international peace day on 21 september ghani suggested that what he called ‘the spanish model’ of dealing with its past could be a model for afghanistan in spain after the death of the fascist dictator general francisco franco in 1975 a decision was made not to talk about the previous thirty years in spain ghani said this ‘pact of forgetting’ as it became known culminated in the 1977 amnesty law which blocked the investigation of francoera crimes leaving uninvestigated the mass graves of more than 100000 people however the spanish model remains politically controversial with successive leftleaning governments providing greater recognition for victims as well as exhumations of mass graves and the removal of some monuments celebrating franco 5 the president’s statement went against the decision of the august 2020 consultative loya jirga that “the government should secure the consent of families of victims of war”  ghani argued that “in the contemporary history of afghanistan we fought against each other and killed each other but tomorrow we need to accept each other as brothers and sisters” he added that the past must not destroy our future and “forgiveness” was what was needed adding that he saw a willingness to forgive in the nation citing the experience of the june 2018 ceasefire aan’s report on the ceasefire here   in the same peace ceremony first vicepresident amrullah saleh spoke for almost 25 minutes but did not say a word about victims as a former director of the national directorate for security nds an institution repeatedly documented as using torture see un reports cited here and aan dossier on torture here and a leading proponent of the former antitaleban coalition the united front better known as ‘northern alliance’ the factions of which have also been accused of war crimes he is not known for his provictim stance nor is he an advocate for the peace process having bluntly stated that he personally is irreconcilable with the taleban   the second vicepresident sarwar danesh is more supportive of emphasising human rights in negotiations with the taleban and has previously pledged that human rights would be respected in any peace process at the peace ceremony he recited verse nine of the hujurat chapter of the quran where it says “… make peace between them fairly and do justice indeed god loves the just” while he did not explain what he meant by a ‘just peace’ he had been speaking about taleban ignorance of shia muslims so this point appeared addressed to the taleban rather than both sides   despite these mixed messages at the top of government there have been modest movements within government in policy terms the state ministry for peace and the afghan islamic republic’s negotiating team both have proposals for the inclusion of victims in the peace process though their plans seem to be in a very early stage   on 13 october the state minister for peace sayed sa’adat mansur naderi and the chairman of the afghan islamic republic’s negotiation team masum stanekzai held their first virtual meeting with representatives of war victims in the meeting naderi promised to establish a special committee consisting of representatives victims victims’ organisations the high council for national reconciliation in the ministry to manage victims’ affairs related to the peace talks stanekzai said the war victims would be “the central part of the peace talks” he added that the experience of other countries had revealed that in nonexclusive peace talks victims were the most vulnerable group   prior to this on 22 september 2020 the state ministry of peace hosted a victims’ hearing session in the presidential palace where ghani had proposed the spanish model for afghanistan just a day earlier the deputy minister for human rights and civil society dr alema in her inauguration speech promised that her ministry in cooperation with ‘relevant organisations’ was establishing “structures and mechanisms” to ensure victims’ participation in the peace process she insisted that the warring parties “must” listen to the victims of war and make sure that “victims benefit from the peace agreement the most”   meanwhile it appears that the afghan negotiation team has formed a committee representing victims’ rights though this has not been well publicised on 16 september 2020 team member habiba sarabi told aan that she is the chair of the team’s committee for human rights women’s rights vulnerable groups and victims and that it has a mandate to communicate with victims and relevant civil society organisations to collect their views sarabi said that she was in regular contact with the aihrc the afghanistan human rights and democracy organisation and the afghanistan mechanism for inclusive peace which is an civil society organisations joint initiative the day she spoke to aan she had held her first official round of talks with these organisations shaharzad akbar the chairwoman of aihrc confirmed having been in contact with sarabi told aan on 9 october 2020 that she was glad at least that the afghan government negotiating team had created such a committee because human rights organisations like aihrc now had an ‘address’ to give their recommendations to she hoped the taleban would do the same previously after president ghani presented his peace plan the geneva conference on afghanistan in 2018 the government retrospectively added a victims’ affairs committee to the plan read aan’s analysis on the 2018 peace plan here however this committee never came into being nor did nine others also mentioned in the peace plan as bodies to address various segments of the afghan society instead the state ministry for peace was established in june 2019 within the ministry no department is designated as covering victims’ affairs though the department of programmes is in contact with some victims’ groups  these developments show that victims have some allies in government which brings a little hope that the committee and the ministry’s consultations may bring some positive developments for victims however there are evident contradictions between these promises of greater inclusion and the stark words and actions of president ghani including the prisoner release made under us pressure overall the dominant view within the ghani administration is that justice will have to wait for peace 6 these contradictions could be the result of divisions between government factions and the lack of any serious efforts to find a consensus or it could suggest a lack of interest from the afghan government allowing space only for tokenistic gestures towards inclusion alternatively the afghan government might be responding to pressure from third parties like the us in the case of the taleban prisoners’ release some in the government negotiating team believe that the strategy of the government representing victims is bad policy in a 1tv discussion on the victims’ place in the peace talks dr amin ahmadi a member of the government negotiating team argued that victims and other relevant stakeholders should selfmobilise and act independently from the afghan government his argument was that the government’s involvement could politicise victims’ involvement creating new hurdles for their direct participation in the talks  the taleban’s stand  the taleban have not taken any public position on the inclusion of victims’ representatives in the peace talks nor have they commented on demands from victims’ groups’ and human rights institutions they also did not answer aan’s questions on this subject which were submitted twice to muhammad na’im wardak the taleban’s spokesperson   however based on the taleban agreement with the us full text here it could be argued that the taleban have not taken the victims’ rights seriously after around 18 months of talks behind closed doors the taleban and us signed this agreement in february 2020 to bring a conditional end to their conflict while the taleban in its regular incident reports often accuse us troops of killing civilians or committing war crimes they signed an agreement with the us in which accountability for war crimes or civil remedies for victims of those crimes is not mentioned as the discussions happened behind closed doors it is not clear whether justice for victims was a topic ever raised by the taleban or not but they have made no public comment on the participation of victims or their representatives in the ustaleban discussions or intraafghan talks   it is notable that five victims of unlawful detention and other abuses by the us at guantanamo are among the taleban’s representatives in the current peace talks though their presence relates more to the legitimacy the experience has conferred on them within the movement rather than informing any policies related to accountability or justice taleban positions on guantánamo over the years have focused only on the release of their own people not the rights of other afghans or detainees of other nationalities being illegally detained in the negotiations to exchange those five prisoners for seargent bowe bergdahl which was made in 2014 aan reporting here the taleban actually refused to try to get other nontaleban detainees out as part of the swap according to aan colleague kate clark who has written extensively on this subject for example here  the taleban negotiating team also includes senior leaders whose potential war crimes are documented this includes command responsibility for potential war crimes while the geneva conventions encourages warring parties to provide the “broadest possible amnesty” to fighters at the end of hostilities this does not apply to those who had command responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity 7 this would implicate members of the taleban senior leadership    the us position  the us has no diplomatic track record of taking the rights or needs of afghan victims into account beyond some forms of compensation payments rather it has long made its hostility towards accountability measures in cases of allegations of war crimes clear with regards to its own forces but also its afghan allies it signed a number of bilateral agreements with the afghan government to limit investigation of its military personnel by the afghan government or a third party starting in 2003 with the status of forces agreement sofa and most recently the bilateral security agreement bsa signed in 2014 the bsa declared that the afghan government could not investigate us forces accused of crimes nor could it hand them over to a third party   the us claimed it would prosecute any wrongdoers through domestic judicial bodies however wrongdoers are rarely put through a judicial process and few have received even received any bureaucratic sanctions such as loss of pay or being fired some such as the head of bagram detention centre were promoted after a detainee died after being tortured on his watch 8 the failure to deal adequately with alleged perpetrators of war crimes the attention of the international criminal court particularly with regards to cia torture aan’s analyses here and here    in the february 2020 ustaleban agreement like the taleban the us did not insist on any accountability for the victims of war crimes allegedly committed by the taleban indeed it agreed to the release of more than 5000 taleban prisoners convicted in afghan courts for a variety of crimes including murder for instance according to the afghan government the mastermind behind the massive may 2017 explosion at the green zone of kabul close to the german embassy which killed nearly 100 people and injured 350 others was among them 105 prisoners were also released despite outstanding complaints by individual plaintiffs’  – maybe victims or their relatives – against them 9   conclusion  there is still time for the afghan government and taleban – and the us as a major actor still in the context of the doha peace talks – to demonstrate to victims of the war that they are seen and heard a small chink of light has been offered by the state ministry for peace and the afghan government negotiating team’s promises to establish mechanisms to consult with victims the proposals from human rights organisations for the inclusion of victims in the peace talks provide principles and potential structures that could further elaborate those mechanisms however these modest gains stand in contrast to the striking lack of political will among those charged with making peace the afghan government the taleban and the us the so far only limited mobilisation and organisation of victims is also a hurdle  the afghan government is divided though its leadership is generally hostile to ideas of accountability for and remembering of the past president ghani favours forgiveness – or a “pact of forgetting” that would echo the failed spanish experiment this approach is already reflected in the 2007 ‘amnesty law’ and bolstered by the continued political clout of the former leaders of mujahedin groups who were involved in the war before 2001 including abdullah abdullah who chairs the high council for national reconciliation as well both of president ghani’s vicepresidents the former mujahidin commanders fear that by opening the door to the past the crimes of the pre2001 era would be investigated  the taleban have demonstrated no interest in the rights of victims during the peace process or prior to it concentrating only on the rights of their own members they have made clear they expect a blanket amnesty including for those most responsible for the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the taleban’s case which has some highranking figures in their negotiating team this threat may discourage the taleban from opening the floor to victims’ representative during the peace talks  the us has in practice demonstrated no desire to push for accountability either of its own forces or allies the us made an agreement with the taleban on prisoner release with no consultation with victims or the afghan government in a clear indication of its willingness to overlook the demands of the victims as the price to pay to get the taleban to sign its agreement   despite these obstacles victims and human rights organisations still have avenues ahead they can support the limited number of political allies in the government by mobilising victims the media and other sympathetic voices efforts to shift the language towards a victimcentred peace may help persuade the government and taleban leadership that the inclusion of victims does not necessarily mean trials but raises possibilities of compensation and healing that even their fighters can benefit from afghanistan has had many decades of evading past crimes but president ghani would do well to learn the real lesson from spain which is that you can enforce a silence on victims but you can never make them forget   edited by rachel reid kate clark and thomas ruttig  1 the afghanistan independent human rights commission aihrc has a long track record of working for war victims’ rights in 2004 it published a report as a result of a national consultation with war victims to reflect their views on how to deal with pre2001 war crimes and war criminals called “a call for justice” the afghan government then developed a threeyear transitional justice national action plan from 20058 which mandated the aihrc to document war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated from 1978 to 2001 the documentation was completed in 2012 and the “conflict mapping report” was shared with hamid karzai the former president when he was in the office and then with ashraf ghani the current president both men refused to publish it  2 the network with technical and logistical support of afghanistan human rights and democracy organisation ahrdo has organised four regional gatherings so far with three more to be completed by midoctober according to chairperson hadi marifat once these regional gatherings are complete elected representatives of each region will come to kabul to convene the victims’ national assembly to decide on their demands and how to engage with the peace negotiating teams and other relevant actors  3 brahimi a former foreign minister of algeria cited chile as an example of justice being sacrificed for peace while giving south africa as an example of accountability being jettisoned in favour of a truth and reconciliation process see “transcript of the press conference by the srsg for afghanistan lakhdar brahimi” 27 august 2002  4 for more detail on these events see aan’s 2013 report on transitional justice in afghanistan “tell us how this ends discussing transitional justice”  5 general franco ruled spain from 1939 to 1975 the ‘pact of forgetting” was hailed by the strong conservative forces in the country some of them with roots in the francoist movement and originally also the socialist party psoe as a necessity to allow the country to transition to democracy others decried the policy with divisions on the issue and in society continuing after the 30 years had elapsed in 2007 a historical memory law was passed by the then socialist government which went some way towards recognising calls from victims for the exhumation of mass graves and removal of public symbols commemorating franco though it was not fully implemented in september 2020 a new bill was introduced the democratic memory law which among other things makes the state responsible for identifying victims buried in mass graves see media reports here here and here and this report of a human rights organisation  6 the afghan government sought to block efforts of the international criminal court icc to open an investigation in afghanistan trying to shield itself by taking small administrative steps towards addressing war crimes such as creating a war crimes unit in the office of the attorney general however it has failed to hold any senior officials accountable for the potential crimes of interest to the icc mostly torture and extrajudicial killings on the part of the afghan government for more see this human rights watch report  7 article 65 of additional protocol ii to the geneva conventions “at the end of hostilities the authorities in power shall endeavour to grant the broadest possible amnesty to persons who have participated in the armed conflict or those deprived of their liberty for reasons related to the armed conflict whether they are interned or detained”   8 there has been no prosecution of anyone involved in the death of gul rahman in bagram in 2002 who froze to death on the bare concrete floor of a cell in cia custody after interrogators ordered his clothes removed because he was being “uncooperative” a cia review listed contributing factors leading to his death “dehydration lack of food and immobility due to ‘short chaining’ ie being held on a short chain ”his case was referred to the us justice department it decided not to bring charges and in 2012 the us attorney general prosecutors announced that the investigation would be closed because “the admissible evidence would not be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt” see here and here the 2014 us senate report into the cia’s use of torture detailed how in march 2003 “just four months after the death of gul rahman the cia station in country recommended that redacted cia officer receive a “cash award” of 2500 for his “consistently superior work” the manger of the detention side stayed in position and “was formally certified as a cia interrogator in april 2003 after the practical portion of his training requirement was waived because of his past experience with interrogations” at the

“the entire peace process must be victimcentered just and aimed at healing the wounds of victims of war and avoiding future recurrence of violence and crime”  resolution  conference of war victims’ families and relatives on the start of intraafghan peace talks   decades of devastating and brutal war have claimed countless victims among the oppressed people of afghanistan largely among the civilian population with women and children often the primary targets people have paid the irreparable human material and spiritual price of war with their lives properties rights and interests  now that “negotiations and peace talks between afghans” has started we the families and relatives of the victims of war and violence call for our active participation in this process so that our voices are heard and our concerns are taken into account in all its aspects and reflected in the final agreements we call on all negotiating parties to recognize the active participation of victims in the negotiation process as one of the main pillars of sustainable peace and do not allow the negotiation process lead to the revictimization of war victims  according to the islamic and international humanitarian rights civilians women children public property infrastructures civil property the sick and those who surrender in battle are considered absolutely safe and any assault on them is considered a “war crime” the comparative experience of the countries involved in the conflict shows that a thorough handling of and accountability for violations committed during war and conflict is one of the inviolable principles of permanent peace that ensures the irreversibility of wars and conflict without a reasonable and transparent mechanism to deal with conflictrelated crimes and violations we could face fragile peace in the most optimistic scenario and in the worst case civil conflicts would return with greater intensity war crimes can be dealt with legally judicially and in accordance with international human rights instruments and national laws the perpetrators of these crimes should be held accountable and their sentence cannot be suspended and not can it be subject to statutes of limitation the time after which a crime cannot be tried in court  we believe that peace cannot be realistic and sustainable without respect for human rights justice and equality and ending of culture of impunity and violence the essential precondition for the implementation of human rights and justice in the peace process is to allow active and meaningful participation of war victims in the peace negotiation process and to establish a mechanism to address the rights and rational demands of the victims   victims of human rights violations in addition to the enjoyment of human rights enshrined in the universal declaration of human rights and other national and international instruments must have effective equal and nondiscriminatory access to justice and to the competent judicial institutions that uphold their human rights damage to victims should be compensated in a rational equitable and timely manner opportunities should be provided for rehabilitation and eventually it should be ensured that their rights are not violated again  peace is not just an absence of war and temporary ceasefire but a situation in which all citizens enjoy their human rights without discrimination have access to justice and live a dignified peaceful and nonviolent life   our basic requests as families and relatives of war victims from the ongoing peace process are as follows   our first demand from the parties to the intraafghan peace talks is “a permanent countrywide ceasefire” to prevent the killing of more civilians the parties shall concentrate on the country’s best interests and afghanistan’s suffering people and victims and strive to make good use of this historic opportunity to achieve a just victimcentered and sustainable peace in which the afghan people’s human rights and civilian rights are guaranteed negotiations should provide victims with access to justice truth and compensation for material and spiritual harms and should ensure that such disasters do not happen again addressing the past and the rights of victims should be an integral part of the peace process agenda  we call on the negotiating teams of the islamic republic of afghanistan and the taliban to establish a joint special committee to follow up on the basic demands of the victims and their families as soon as possible and this structure is to be a key part of the negotiation process mechanism set up a victimcentered peace working group to work in a focused and organized way with negotiating groups on both sides and hold talks with the joint special committee for victims’ affairs and other relevant groups and committees assist in the systematic handling of the victims’ basic demands and ensure a permanent and durable peace  families and relatives of afghanistan war

68,november 2520 switzerland replacement armasuisse which is the swiss federal office for defense procurement announced that it has received the second set of proposals for the country’s air2030 neues kampfflugzeug new fighter aircraft nkf as well as groundbased air defense system the offers to replace the swiss air force’s f5ef tiger ii and fa18 hornet fleets were made by germany for airbus eurofighter france for the dassault rafale and the united states for the boeing fa18ef super hornet and lockheed martin f35a lightning joint strike fighter the ddps said the proposals included the prices for 36 and 40 aircraft including logistics and weapons as a binding starting point for negotiations with the winning offer after type selection   the fa18 hornet is the fa18 ef super hornet‘s predecessor with the first models introduced in the late 1970s as a spinoff of the usaf’s yf17 lightweight fighter competitor hornets are currently flown by the us marine corps as their frontline fighter by the us navy as a secondtier fighter behind its larger fa18 ef super hornets and by 7 international customers australia canada finland kuwait malaysia spain and switzerland the usa’s aircraft were expected to have a service life of 20 years but that was based on 100 carrier landings per year the us navy and marines have been rather busy during the hornets’ service life and so the planes are wearing out faster this is forcing the usa to take a number of steps in order to keep their hornets airworthy replacing center barrel sections reopening production lines and more some of these efforts will also be offered to allied air forces who have their own refurbishment and upgrade programs   some of the parts procured under boeing’s contracts will be produced for allied military services who fly the fa18 the hornet was a mcdonnelldouglas aircraft so contracts will generally be to that boeing subsidiary in st louis mo unless otherwise noted note that “center barrel sections” refer to the middle chunk of the plane where the wings joint the body as one might guess replacing them is a somewhat involved process and is also very helpful in extending the airframe’s fatiguehour limits  there are some gaps in this article’s coverage national mro maintenance repair  optimization initiatives don’t get comprehensive coverage beyond the multifleet central contracts announced in the usa though some coverage and links are present there’s also a thin line at times between upgrades required to remain survivable and hence useful in national fleets and airframe lifeextension efforts in theory they’re different but in practice they’re often linked as such leaving all upgrades out would do readers a disservice so they occasionally appear when there’s a connection again however lists of upgrades are not comprehensive note that hornet fighters use different radars raytheon’s apg65 is installed aboard usn and usmc fa18cd hornets both radar types and the usmc’s av8b

originally canada had intended to supplement its fleet of 85 boeing cffa18 ab fighters with 18 new boeing fa18 ef super hornets this plan was cancelled in favor of the australian hornets when boeing accused canada’s bombardier of receiving unfair subsidies from ottawa before the aircraft can be integrated into the canadian fleet of cf188 hornets they will undergo several modifications in mirabel quebec they have to be brought to the same operational configuration as the canadian cf188 hornets this means cockpit and communications upgrades a night vision imaging system a sniper targeting pod landing gear modifications a new ejection seat as well as the air force paint scheme june 2116 pressure is mounting on the pentagon to approve the sale of fa18 super hornets to kuwait though us navy secretary ray mabus has warned that his service will have to pay more to buy the fa18 due to cost increases according to mabus boeing needs more orders so that it can keep producing the fighter at an

june 716 canada looks set to procure an interim fleet of boeing fa18 super hornets to fill a capability gap as it procrastinates on how to proceed with its new fighter competition the liberal party leader justin trudeau promised during the election campaign not to buy the f35 to replace its aging cf18s but the government has been struggling with how to fulfill that promise for fear any attempt to exclude the stealth fighter from a competition will result in a multibilliondollar lawsuit according to one senior defence department official may 1216 software updates for the fa18 and ea18g have

contract n0001909c0052 nov 1512 usn life extension the us gao publishes gao1351 “better cost estimates needed for extending the service life of selected f16s and fa18s” the lateness of the f35 and high flighthour usage over iraq and afghanistan are making it hard to keep fighter numbers up current usaf plans involve 261 billion to upgrade at least 300 of 1020 f16s to fly another 2000 hours est 68 years each add more advanced radars etc the usn would spend about 219 billion to keep 150 of 624 fa18ad hornet fighters flying for another 1400 flight hours est 5 years each alongside a separate buy of 41 more fa18ef super hornets the alternative is a more expensive approach that would buy new f16s or super hornets they would cost much more but last 4x5x as long the problem is that the cost of new planes is known but costs of fixing existing aircraft to cover for additional f35 delays or add new capabilities aren’t as clear f16 upgrades could rise to 650 planes and fa18 hornet life extension could rise to 280 planes with the possibility of added capability upgrades the us navy’s 2011 plan for its hornet fleet would take place over fy 20132017 the planes to be upgraded would be specially chosen presumably for low wear and structural integrity they would also be individually evaluated for capability enhancements but those aren’t in the 219 billion budget current estimates involve another 176 million per hornet for capability upgrades and an average of 564 million more if the hornets need structural life extension and obsolescence replacement that gives us a figure of between 219 – 33 billion if 150 hornets are upgraded 146 – 22 million per plane and the upper ends of that figure offer poorer longterm value for money than buying a new super hornet in the mid60 million range if costs are linear the total for a 280 plane program would be between 409 – 616 billion but costs are often not linear hence the gao’s recommendation to do a full sensitivity analysis so decision makers can fully understand the range of navy costs between 219 – 616 billion sept 2812 aging in australia the australian reports that the raaf has been ordered to scale back its usage of its modernized fa18ambm hornets in order to keep them viable until f35 begin arriving in the early 2020s aging is taking a serious toll and 6271 fighters had “structure fatigue above that expected for the airframe hours” meanwhile annual maintenance costs for australia’s hornet fleet were a118 million in 2001 a 170 million in 2012 and is expected to be a 214 million by 2018 the anao sees costs

times article details the efforts underway to keep the us navy’s fleet of fa18 ad hornet fighters in service until some of them can be replaced by f35bc jets the usn’s fa18 program manager capt mark darrah is quoted as saying that the hornet fleet is averaging about 330 flighthours per year which means they’re consistently about 30 above planned usage many have now exceeded even their extended usage figure of 8000 flight hours fortunately their accident rate remains low carrier air wing 7 commander capt roy kelley adds that the fa18ef super hornet fleet is also burning through airframe hours with 73 of the fleet’s 418 aircraft already over 3000 hours – wich is about halfway through their safe design lifetimes the navy hopes to extend its hornet airframes to 10000 safe flight hours up from the easier target of 8600 each plane costs about 15 million when put through the deep inspections and refurbishment program it’s accompanied by detailed recordkeeping and a constant juggling act among the squadrons darrah says that navairnaf’s quarterly modification review “literally makes the decisions every quarter on bureau number by bureau number what aircraft will be assigned to what units” based heavily on flight hour and maintenance issues once on the carrier that juggling continues networking has made flight data files compilable and accessible across the fleet allowing for

and the first quarter of 2020 according to the authors’ dataset the number of reported islamic state attacks increased from 1470 in 2018 to 1669 in 2019 with 566 reported attacks in the first quarter of 2020 alone1 these nationallevel figures supported by detailed qualitative and provincebyprovince breakdowns in the following sections paint a picture of a militant organization that is reestablishing itself in iraq possibly drawing in the authors’ assessment on a cadre of experienced tactical leaders and bomb makers that returned from the syrian battlefields in 20192 a as prior articles in ctc sentinel have noted3 the movement has undertaken an agile fluid and pragmatic shift back to insurgency in every area of iraq where the group has lost physical control of populations and resources in areas such as diyala province which this publication identified in 20164 as the likely future locus for islamic state operations5 the insurgency has been continuously operating since 2003 and is now recovering strongly becoming the most active islamic state wilaya province in 2019 and 2020b this article extends the metricsbased analysis used in two prior ctc sentinel pieces in 2017 and 20186 adding a further year and a half of islamic state attack metrics in iraq picking up from october 2018 where the last analysis ended to the end of march 2020c as in the prior study this article looks at islamic state attacks in anbar salah aldin baghdad’s rural “belts”d nineveh kirkuk and diyala to maximize comparability this analysis used exactly the same data collection and collation methodologye as the december 2018 ctc sentinel study attacks were again broken down into explosivef or nonexplosive events and also by the four categories of highquality attacks effective roadside bombingsg attempts to overrun iraqi security force checkpoints or outpostsh personspecific targeted attacksi and attempted masscasualty attacksj like any set of attack metrics this analysis is drawing on a partial sample which probably favors more visible attacks types explosions major attacks over more subtle enemyinitiated actions such as kidnap or intimidation nevertheless much can be learned from the immersive manual coding of thousands of geospatiallymapped attacks in the following sections the authors will look at national attacks trends then proceed governoratebygovernorate to view the variegated nature of attack trends in different tactical environments and finally review qualitative trends in attack quality and discuss the possible factors behind the islamic state’s partial recovery inside iraq overall national trends in islamic state activity the december 2018 ctc sentinel study of islamic state attack metrics told the story of a steep decline in operational activities in iraq in late 2017 that extended into the following year the islamic state undertook a monthly average of 4906 attacks in 2017 dropping sharply to 1225 per month in 20187 this decline continued into 2019 with attacks bottomingout at an average of 973 attacks per month in the second quarter of 20198 in every quarter since then the overall national tally of islamic state attacks has grown in q2 2019 there were 132 attacks per month followed by 1436 attacks per month in q3 20199 in the last quarter of 2019 there were 1833 attacks per month and there were 1886 attacks per month in q1 202010 the yearonyear comparison of attacks in q1 2019 versus q1 2020 shows a 94 increase in attacks from 292 in the first quarter of 2019 to 566 in the first quarter of this year11 the almost doubling of attacks in a year is strong and steady recovery by anyone’s standardsk even if the islamic state is still a shadow of its former self in overall attack numbers according to the sigact database in 2019 the islamic state undertook 1669 attacks in iraq much lower than the 5888 in 2017 or the 6216 in 2013 and a tiny fraction of the 50159 enemyinitiated attacks in the year of peak violence in 200712 a breakdown of the attack metrics by broad categories provides further insights into the nature of the partial recovery at the national level the proportion of explosive to nonexplosive events stayed roughly stable over the coverage period 18 months or six quarters from october 1 2018 to march 31 2020 with explosive incidents varying from 4153 of all attacks across the quarters13 explosive incidents more than doubled in raw numbers between the low of 403 per month in q1 2019 and 873 per month in q1 202014 the rough mirroring of the increase in explosive attack events to the growth of all attack events provides reinforcing evidence of an overall trend of steady recovery of islamic state attacks due to the relatively high confidence analysts can have that explosive events will be missed less often and represent a more reliable category of metric if counted diligentlyl once again though the islamic state is capable of delivering 826 explosive attacks a year in 201915 this is still a pale shadow of the industrialscale bombings of 2017 2868 2013 3316 or even a previous low point of islamic state operations in 2011 1704 when the group operated under the name the islamic state of iraq16 at the national level highquality attacks which also tend to be highervisibility also rose by 141 from 104 highquality attacks in q1 2019 to 251 such incidents in q1 202017 between these two bookend quarters the recovery was steady with highquality attacks rising to 153 in q2 2019 195 in q3 and 298 in q418 this recovery of quality attacks was not uniform across the different subclasses however 2019 witnessed strong growth in effective roadside bombings from 308 in 2018 to 402 in 201919 and in overrun attempts on checkpoints and bases from 135 in 2018 to 234 in 201920 the number of targeted killings of tribal chiefs and village elders called mukhtars steeply declined from 167 in 2018 to 79 in 2019 as did attacks intended to create mass casualties from 141 in 2018 to 59 in 201921 in q1 2018 there were eight attempted masscasualty attacks reportedly causing 32 deaths and 124 persons wounded in q1 2019 there were five attempted masscasualty attacks and 11 killed and 51 wounded in q1 2020 there were three attempted masscasualty attacks and two killed and 21 wounded this suggests a downward trend in masscasualty attacks and per attack lethality22 qualitative analysis of attack patterns at the local level which will be explored in full in the below sections suggests an influx of higherquality tactical leaders and bomb makers in the second quarter of 2019 a date range that coincides with the collapse of the last pockets of islamic state territorial control in syriam  some of the most interesting trends can be observed by looking at the differing situations in the provinces suffering from islamic state insurgency—anbar baghdad diyala kirkuk nineveh and salah aldin in 2018 kirkuk was the most attacked province 370 attacks followed by diyala 340 and baghdad 328n in 2019 the order changed diyala was by far the most attacked 550 well ahead of newly secondranked nineveh 293 kirkuk 228 baghdad 214 salah aldin 142 and anbar 10523 o in q1 2020 kirkuk slipped even lower—ranked fifth of the six provinces in attack numbers with 46 attacks in the quarter ie not comparable to the annual figures above24 in the first quarter of this year diyala had the most attacks 140 followed by baghdad 106 and nineveh 97p across the last 27 months of metrics monitored by the authors ie all of 2018 and 2019 plus q1 2020 diyala has been the most consistently active operating environment for the islamic state totaling 1030 attacks versus 644 for kirkuk and 601 in ninevehq to dig more deeply into provincial dynamics and trends the following sections will proceed governoratebygovernorate across the six areas anbar in the author’s december 2018 ctc sentinel metrics analysis anbar had the fewest islamic state attacks and this pattern held for most of 201925 in 2018 the monthly average of islamic state attacks in anbar was 70 and in 2019 it showed little annual change at 87 per month26 yet the insurgency in anbar showed signs of evolution even as attack numbers stayed low from q2 2019 onward anbar saw the return of attempted masscasualty attacks including tentative efforts to restore an ability to strike in cities like ramadi and hit27 intimidation of rural tribes increased including terror tactics such as attempted suicide bombings targeting markets mosques and shepherds28 larger and newerlooking weapons caches began to show up in the hit to ramadi corridor suggestive of materiel having been moved down the euphrates river valley in 2019 and staged within striking distance of hit ramadi fallujah and baghdadr by q1 2020 anbar was a much more active theater of war with monthly average attacks jumping to 276—triple the average of 201929 roadside bombings are now more common tripling from 19 per month in 2019 to 66 per month in q1 202030 a favored target set appears to be the softskinned civilian vehicles of the popular mobilization force pmf units moving along the desert highway system between alqaim and rutbah which are struck from rural redoubts on the high plateau of wadi horan a launchpad that is ringed on all sides by major highways31 the first quarter of 2020 also saw largerscale tactical operations at platoon strength 30 or more men with rocketpropelled grenades rpgs and mortars as well as more sniper attacks and efforts to kill village mukhtars32 as noted anbar ended q1 2020 as the fourth most active province in iraq for the islamic state but this trend requires constant monitoring because anbar’s insurgency has a pattern of regular peaks and troughs over the last two years33 possibly indicative of disruptive counterinsurgency by iraq’s very active jazeera and albadiyah operations command and anbar operations commands if the trend continues then anbar will have returned to roughly the attack levels seen in 2012 when there was an average of 33 attacks per month34 salah aldin whereas salah aldin was a consistent provider of attack metrics in the pre2011 insurgency being astride the northsouth main supply route of us forces it remains a comparatively sleepy province for today’s islamic state consistently the lowest or secondlowest ranked province for attacks salah aldin is nonetheless seeing signs of islamic state recovery in 2019 islamic state attacks in salah aldin experienced four minisurges followed by dips in january may september and december but each was stronger than the last one and left the overall attack numbers at a higher level after it concluded attacks per month rose from 13 in q1 2019 to 246 in q3 and 35 per month in q4 and then stayed close to this level in q1 202035 t for comparison this is still far lower than the 116 monthly attacks in 2013 or the 84 monthly attacks in 2017 but higher than 2012 levels of 19 attacks per month36 in the authors’ assessment the growth patterns in 2019 create the sense of an insurgency that is being primed and exercised progressively warmingup different corners of the province qualitative analysis provides further insights the strongest apparent trend is an injection of bombmaking and roadside bomb emplacement capability in q3 201937 u as well as a shift toward taking on isolated checkpoints in standup fights involving platoonsized islamic state units38 v suggestive in the authors’ assessment of improved tactical leadership countercollaboration strikes on sunni preachers and tribal mobilization force officers are on the increase39 there were three targeted killings in salah aldin in the first half of 2019 versus five in the second half of 201940 in the authors’ assessment the strongest islamic state operating environment in salah aldin is the jallam desert which backs onto a range of target systems such as samarra the alas oilfield tuz khurmatu and provincial borders with southern kirkuk and western diyala41 w nineveh nineveh was fully liberated from islamic state territorial control in august 2017 and was the scene of a patchy and reasonably weak islamic state insurgency during 2018 averaging 175 attacks per month42 as the december 2018 ctc sentinel metrics analysis noted however the rate of attacks was steadily increasing by the end of 201843 x with a focus on the rural tigris river valley trv areas south of mosul city this gradual increase gave way to a more sudden uptick in attacks in the second half of 2019 when there were 341 attacks per month about double the 2018 levels44 this rate of attacks was sustained in q1 202045 y suggesting to the authors a fairly stable new plateau of attacks in nineveh today’s insurgency in nineveh is still miniscule compared to islamic state performance in prior years there were 278 attacks per month in 2013 of which 2185 occurred in mosul city46 in march 2020 there were just 31 attacks in the province and no enemyinitiated attacks in the city47 available metrics starkly underline the deactivation of urban mosul as an insurgent operating environment in 2013 there were a total of 2622 attacks in mosul city versus 22 in 201948 this means that mosul suffered as many attacks in a year 2019 as were occurring every three days in 201349 out in the rural areas the islamic state has been much more active the sustained surge of attacks since the summer of 2019 was driven primarily by a steep increase in the number and quality of roadside bombings50 z in 2018 there were 41 effective roadside bombings per month in nineveh a rate that tripled to 131 such attacks per month in the second half of 2019 and which was sustained near this higher level in q1 202051 aa as in other parts of iraq the third quarter of 2019 saw a gradual proliferation of advanced tactics by ied teams in nineveh “daisychaining” of multiple ieds to expand kill zones boobytrapping houses to kill security forces and “comeon” attacks using tactical actions to draw forces onto roadside bombs52 in 2018 the islamic state had terrorized southern nineveh’s trv with “mukhtar slayings”—nocturnal raids to kill village leaders53 though the practice certainly has not stopped it did become less frequent in q1 2018 an average of 53 such targeted assassinations were undertaken each month while by q1 2020 the rate had more than halved to two per month54 one driver for this reduction in attacks on mukhtars may be the added protection granted by the activation in may 2019 of an expansive network of “village guard” forces in 50 villages in the trv south of mosul an initiative developed specifically to give hamlets some capacity to defend against nocturnal raids55 despite this partial success the islamic state now has a wider range of attack cells operational in nineveh than one year ago with distinct attack groups operational in at least 11 areasab in q1 2020 versus six in december 2018 kirkuk kirkuk poses a real analytical quandary having been the most active province for islamic state attacks in 2018 with 308 attacks per month but slipping to third ranking in 2019 with 112 monthly attacks and fifth ranking in q1 2020 with 153 monthly attacks put in the shade by more active islamic state cells in other provinces56 attack analysis reveals there was a steep decline in highquality attacks in kirkuk since 2018 with an average of 151 highquality attacks per month in 2018 and only 32 in the latter half of 2019 and 36 in q1 202057 roadside bombings halved in the same period and “mukhtar slayings” appear to have almost disappeared from 35 per month in 2018 to 075 per month in the latter half of 201958 ac is this impression of a downturn in attacks credible and if so why did it occur against a backdrop of nationallevel islamic state regrowth first it is worth remembering that kirkuk was never a particularly hightempo province for the islamic state even in its heyday in 2013 the average number of monthly attacks was 57 and was just 26 per month in 201159 in the authors’ view the insurgencies in kirkuk—arguably a cluster of rather localized tribal resistance actions—have always had a detached and semiautonomous feelad a primary factor may be the swamping of the kirkuk rural heartland with security forces since later 2018 a trend that the december 2018 ctc sentinel analysis noted was resulting in a downturn of attack numbers60 the footprint of the security forces in rural areas of kirkuk was systematically reinforced from around four federal police brigades in the first quarter of 2018 to the current total around 12 federal police and three army brigades61 federal police operations also improved during the course of 2019 as they acclimated to the local conditions and geography pushing out into peripheral rural areas and stepping up patrolling of secondary local road systems62 the addition of a us special forces effort based out of k1 airbase outside kirkuk city in q4 2018 which coordinated iraqi counterinsurgency operations in the province despite harassment by iranbacked militias and drove an aggressive campaign of raids into rural insurgent sanctuaries by iraqi counterterrorism forces for most of 2019 further increased the pressure on the local insurgency63 though fewer visible islamic state attacks were logged in kirkuk the ferocity of the witnessed actions in 2019 cannot be doubted the islamic state managed to mount a series of small anticivilian ied bombings against kirkuk city in the middle months of the year as well as a vindictive harassment campaign against the villages of the kakai microminorityae along the kirkuk to baghdad highway64 af though less frequently community leaders have still been murdered and intimidated in one case a tribal sheikh’s daughter was beheaded65 ag insurgents have been kidnapping and ransoming farmersah and extorting money using the threat to destroy irrigation pumps and farm vehicles66 some of the most sophisticated roadside bombing techniques in iraq were demonstrated in kirkuk in the last year such as ieds set at insurgent mortar launch locations to hit socalled “baseplate patrols” looking for the launch point bombs used to kill quick reaction forces trying to reach a mukhtar site under attack and the explosive boobytrapping of bodies67 baghdad belts rural baghdad functions not only as the outlying agricultural districts of the capital but also as a “ring road” for the islamic state to pass fighters from the euphrates river valley linking syria and anbar toward other wilayat such as salah aldin and diyalaai baghdad’s wealthy ‘exurbs’ truck stops and “farmtomarket” roads and transshipment points are also major potential moneymakers68 aj in 2017 as the december 2018 ctc sentinel metrics study noted the islamic state mounted a very energetic rural intimidation and extortion campaign in the baghdad belts an effort that seemed to collapse by mid2018 for obscure reasonsak in the latter half of 2018 and the first half of 2019 the islamic state’s attack metrics in rural baghdad were weaker than at any time since the insurgency began in 200369 in 2019 islamic state attacks in rural baghdad averaged 178 per month versus 336 per month in the insurgency’s previous national low point in 201170 relief did not last long the level of islamic state activity began a bounce back from early in the third quarter of 2019 in the first half of 2019 attacks averaged 113 per month in the second half 243 per month and in q1 2020 the average reached 353 per month71 though still half of the 2017 average of 673 attacks per month there has undoubtedly been a partial recovery of attack metrics in rural baghdad72 this has partly come from a rise in highquality attacks including a doubling of effective roadside bombings and a steep increase in overrun attacks on rural checkpoints and small patrol bases73 for illustration in the first half of 2019 there were two effective roadside bombings in rural baghdad versus 39 in the second half of the year and 22 alone in q1 202074 likewise there were only two efforts to overrun rural checkpoints in the first half of 2019 versus 26 in the latter half and 10 in q1 202075 by the start of 2020 the rural baghdad area was back to the levels of violence seen at the start of 2018 albeit now focused primarily on security force targets as opposed to civilians76 the increase in islamic state operations around baghdad has manifested primarily in the northern and western belts the northern baghdad belts fall under the islamic state’s shamal albaghdad wilayat which also covers parts of neighboring southern salah addin province77 centered on the historic insurgent bastion of tarmiyah the area is a vital thoroughfare connecting a range of other geographic subsectors of the insurgency including the euphrates corridor west of baghdad and the tigris and diyala river valley systems extending out to the north and east in particular the area seems to serve as hub for fighters and materiel flowing down the euphrates river valley erv from syria and pooling in the triangle between hit fallujahkarma and the southern shores of lake thar thar78 since july 2019 the islamic state has fought far harder to preserve and expand its rural freedom of movement in northern baghdad areas like tarmiyah mushahidah taji and soba saab albour79 the islamic state has seen a gradual evolution from a primarily assassinationbased mode of resistance in the first half of 2019 to a more varied model that includes use of advanced ieds and bombing tactics daisychaining and comeon attacks boobytrapped houses and sniper operations80 in western baghdad one factor boosting the province’s overall numbers was the reactivation of an effective roadside bombing cell in the abu ghraib area in 201981 in the southern belts an old insurgent operating zone in madain also reactivated one factor resulting in southern baghdad experiencing as many attacks in q1 2020 as in the whole of 2019al diyala as flagged by the authors in a ctc sentinel analysis in 201682 the diyala wilaya has strong potential to be the most consistent producer of islamic state attacks in iraq because of the intense sectarian tensions in this crosssectarian province and because the islamic state never actually controlled diyala and thus never had to suffer the disruption of adjusting back to an insurgency model this has been borne out with diyala showing by far the highest aggregate provincial attack total over the last 27 months of monitoringam the steep downturn in diyala attacks recorded by the december 2018 ctc sentinel metrics analysis has now been partially reversed though not back up to the 2017 average of 796 attacks per month the second half of 2019 averaged 598 attacks per month before settling down to 458 attacks per month in q1 202083 an this counts as strong and sustained partial recovery as ever tactical and local trends in diyala attacks tell a fascinating and grim story of communities at war in the diyala river valley like kirkuk’s farmlands diyala has a somewhat disconnected dynamic all of its own a war within a war showing a quite different pattern from the islamic state wilayat with closer connections to syria and the western iraqi deserts84 roadside bombing in diyala did increase in quantity and quality during the second half of 2019 hinting at a similar injection of talent as seen in other areasao yet the surge in diyala was broader than ied employment with overrun attempts on security force checkpoints quadrupling from 24 per month in 2018 to an average of 10 per month in the second half of 201985 ap sniping attacks also proliferated rising fourfold from an average of 18 attacks in the first half of 2019 to 76 attacks per month in the latter half of the year86 aq of note the islamic state’s use of snipers in diyala seems particularly innovative covering open locations where security forces can be predictably drawn for prolonged periods such as mortar launch locations and emplaced ieds87 in addition to excluding the security forces from its rural bastions along the diyala river valley the iranian border and the provincial border with salah aldin the islamic state still finds time to wage brutal warfare against kurds shia and uncooperative sunni tribes in diyala in each month diyala witnesses ethnic or sectarian cleansing activities by the islamic state on a scale not seen in other provinces far exceeding such efforts in the crosssectarian melting pots of rural baghdad or southern salah aldin88 ar increasing numbers of barrages of mortar shells are regularly fired from inaccessible rural redoubts into shia kurdish and kakai villagesas even in more lethal and disruptive daytime bombardmentsat houses and crops are burned irrigation machinery is destroyed electricity lines are dropped and very valuable livestock is slaughtered89 for example near khanaqin in september 2019 the islamic state rigged a herd of cows with ieds and drove them into a kurdish hamlet90 in the authors’ assessment the aim of anticivilian attacks in diyala appears to be not only to intimidate and extort but even to depopulate and there have been numerous village evacuations in the mukhisaabu saidamuqdadiyah khanaqin and mutabijah areas91 this extremely vindictive campaign—unfortunately standard practice in diyala since 200392—is beginning to reextend into urban areas such as the provincial capital of baquba where a suicide vest bombing was attempted on an amusement park during the eid alfitr holiday in june 201993  terrain analysis and tactical trends there is enormous analytical value in getting ‘granular’ by immersing longterm subject matter experts in the detail of geolocated attack data interview material and social mediasourced imagery from attack and cache sites in an age where artificial intelligence is beginning to usefully take over some of the ‘grunt work’ of sifting collating and characterizing attack metrics for governments in environments like iraq94 there is an ‘x factor’ that a human analyst brings in terms of pattern recognition and relation of trends to key geographies and human terrain human analysts can be particularly good at asking questions by discerning mystifying and complex trends and identifying ‘known unknowns’—the question that is simultaneously posed by quantitative data yet not easily answered by it one such quandary is the islamic state’s ‘hugging’ of a variety of hilly or ridgeline positionsau running between the syrian and iranian borders with iraq in many cases the islamic state has invested considerable effort to dig in to the slopes of anticlines and plateaus seeding preexisting and newly excavated caves with multipurpose caches that include food water solarpowered or liquidfueled power generators explosive devices bulk explosives bombmaking components trail bikes and even completed car bombs95 the atomization of the islamic state’s logistical tail and beddown locations into hundreds of subterranean shelters recalls hassan hassan’s december 2017 description in this publication of “small selfsustained and autonomous localities to enable militants to defend their areas with minimal movement and without the need for resupply from other districts”96 av these redoubts can be located perilously close to security force garrisons and might appear to be highly vulnerable to surveillance raiding and bombardment—or inviting the security forces to shoot fish in a barrelaw upon closer analysis such positions—characterized by a high water table and rapid changes of elevation and uneven terrain—have obvious factors to recommend them though seemingly compact when viewed on a mapax such areas contain masses of caves for the security forces to find and clear insurgents moving on foot or using trail bikes can relocate between such sites frequently97 many complexes are just 100200ft elevated above the surrounding terrain but are poorly served by roads while the more inaccessible ones are often elevated by 300ft ayadhiyah makhul khanukah pulkhana and the highest by 4001200ft the qani domlan hamrin98 and qara chaugay from the islamic state point of view where a set of foothills are not available a high desert with deepcut wadis and caves will do just as well99 the wadi horan area of anbar and the lake sunisilah area south of baaj are remote and watercut deserts with a low water table with a similarly inhospitable and cavepitted character to low mountain ranges100 another sanctuary is the sprawling wadi systems along the western edges of the kirkuk rural belt which back into the hamrin range and cover some 800 square miles in this area wadi canyons restrict the movement of large vehiclemounted forces while also serving as natural movement corridors for footmobile insurgent raiding parties infiltrating into the farming areas around hawijah and daquq101 aboveground sanctuaries have been developed by the islamic state in densely vegetated ‘green zones’—river delta areas and islands where vehicle movement is limited and channeled by marshes and canals102 az considerable numbers of static victimoperated pressureplate ieds are arrayed around such bastions to deter and slow government clearance operations103 some of the most important islamic state basing sanctuaries qara chaug pulkhana northern diyala and qani domlan have also become more viable since kurdish forces were expelled from these areas by iraqi federal troops in october 2017 which left numerous 510 mile wide ridges often just 1030 miles long but sometimes as in cases like qara chaug and the hamrin mountains as long as 4060 miles in which neither baghdad nor the kurds fully controlled the ground104 in the authors’ assessment the islamic state took fully advantage of this opening and relocated some of their most active attack cells into this “crease” of ungoverned space105 the authors assess that the islamic state seems to seek isolation in unpopulated areas preferring base locations with as few potential government informants as possible106 in addition to seeking out areas with low population density the islamic state seems to try to keep its sanctuary areas depopulated107 interlopers such as shepherds and truffle hunters are frequently killed108 efforts to return displaced persons are deterred and resisted109 including through the use of widespread cropburning by the islamic state110 the islamic state loves nothing better than an abandoned or demolished villageba and where unmanned electrooptical camera masts have been established to oversee such places the islamic state is increasingly shooting out or attacking such masts111 bb desert highway corridors such as the bayjihaditha pipeline road or the bayji to mosul pipeline road are systematically denied to truckers and civilian traffic to prevent interpenetration and visibility of such areas112 the islamic state appears to greatly value its privacy falling in on this impressive physical infrastructure of thousands of prestocked shelters and depopulated sanctuaries is a new influx of experienced fighters from syria largely iraqis113 bc in every province most notably those touching on the euphrates river valley there were signs of an increase in roadside bombing capabilities in the mayjune 2019 period followed by a widespread threemonth surge of islamic state attack operations in augustoctober 2019114 professional bombmaking facilities have been discovered in anbar diyala nineveh and kirkuk that look more like pre2014 insurgent workshops and less like the factories used to churn out crude cylindrical charges for the islamic state’s barrier minefieldsbd tactical leadership also improved both in terms of more advanced tactics techniques and procedures and also a widening of the number of active 625person attack cellsbe according to the authors’ assessment the number of areas with active attack cells seems to nearly double from an assessed 27 areas in december 2018115 to an assessed 47 areas in may 2020 in the authors’ assessment116 the 47 areas are anbar akashat the alqaimabu kamal border area wadi horanrutbah nukhayb the rawahanahhaditha corridor hit ramadi and lake razazah karmah and southern thar and fallujahamiriyat alfallujah

the authors’ approximate but carefully considered calculation of apparent attack cells within each area the active operational core of the insurgency probably numbers around 1300 fulltime insurgent attack cell combatants at the time of writingbf according to the authors’ rough calculations these cells are sustained by a broader active support network including 2700 logistical and financial operatives enforcement and other support personnelbg this larger group probably brings the insurgency in iraq to a core of around 4000 combatant members117 the islamic state insurgency is nested with a larger family and tribebased passive support network that may number up to 10000 adult sympathizers involved in a range of activities including procuring food and other supplies providing safehouses and acting as spies and informants raising the overall number of people potentially supporting islamic state activities in iraq to 14000bh for comparison in january 2020 the us government estimated the presence of “1400018000 islamic state terrorists between syria and iraq” though it is unclear how this number is broken out118 bi explaining the islamic state’s partial recovery in the december 2018 ctc sentinel metrics analysis119 the reactivation of syria as a source of strength for the iraqi insurgency was one of three indicators identified in relation to a potential resurgence of the islamic state inside iraq in developing this article the authors’ research process left the strong impression of an islamic state cadre from syria oozing down the erv pooling in reactivated insurgent hubs west of baghdad in karma and thar thar and in southern nineveh near lake sunnisilah before feeding out into various branches of the insurgency in anbar baghdad salah aldin and nineveh with slightly less noticeable effect on the more distant subtheaters in kirkuk and diyala this impression fits with interview coverage regarding the collapse of the islamic state caliphate in the syrian euphrates and khabur river valleys120 one us officer with direct experience of the deir ezzor intelligence picture in 20182020 told the authors “even before the fall of raqqa there was an operational decision by the islamic state to shift key people and materiel into iraq after raqqa there was lots of movement and relocation”121 this fits with the islamic state’s shift to a “melt away” strategy described by hassan hassan in his seminal december 2017 ctc sentinel article “insurgents again”122 yet no singledriver explanation—such as a transfer of fighters—will ever capture the complexity of the mesmerizing operational patterns of an insurgent movement operating across multiple provinces the december 2018 ctc sentinel metrics analysis123 also suggested two other interrelated drivers for the 20112014 regrowth of the islamic state that could recur again the removal of usled coalition forces and a deterioration in the leadership and effectiveness of the iraqi security forces in the authors’ assessment both these drivers of an islamic state resurgence are also beginning to manifest due to negative developments in 2019 and so far in 2020 the titfortat strikes between iranbacked militias and the united states—set against the backdrop of growing usiran tensions and probable israeli airstrikes in iraq124—have gradually diminished the ability of the coalition to support iraq’s security forces to give tangible examples both us access to iraqi airspace and us ability to interact directly with sunni tribal forces were circumscribed by militiabacked politicians from march and may 2019 onward respectively125 bj throughout 2019 us advisors were excluded from some operations in the tarmiyah nineveh and diyala areas due to pushback from militias126 bk throughout 2019 iraqi military commanders viewed as too close to the united states were transferred out of combat commands following militia pressure on the national and military leadership127 following a lethal militia attack on us forces on december 27 2019128 and the subsequent us and iranian retaliatory operations inside iraq129 many coalition hubs faced a reduced ability to advise iraqi headquarters or to accompany iraqi units outside of fortified camps130 bl on january 5 2020 in the aftermath of the january 3 2020 us killing of qassem soleimani and abu mahdi almuhandis iraq’s parliament issued a nonbinding vote to remove foreign advisors and while the vote lacked quorum131 it nonetheless had a chilling effect on cooperation with many iraqi headquarters left uncertain over the status of cooperation132 bm it is too soon to analyze the full effects of the killing of soleimani and muhandis and broader usiran tensions on the war against the islamic state trends in iraq’s insurgencies often take time to play out while there seemed to be no immediate effort by the islamic state to take advantage of usiran tensions in early q1 2020bn the movement appears to have launched a strong ramadan offensive in q2 2020bo whether it had planned to do so independently of the usiran conflict is impossible to know at this point but this study has pointed to evidence that the islamic state was on an upswing in iraq well before us forces begin to strike militias in late december 2019 what is abundantly clear is that the disruption of coalition support in iraq is of benefit to the islamic state as us special envoy for the global coalition jim jeffrey noted in late january 2020 “obviously there is a possibility of a degradation of the effort against daesh if we’re not able to do the things that we were doing so effectively up until a few weeks ago”133 lacking coalition support the iraqi security forces are neither trained nor equipped to conduct counterinsurgency such forces will remain singularly unprepared for the challenge of higher tempo roadside bombings and overrun attacks as one of the authors noted in an august 2017 ctc sentinel study134 few mine resistant ambushprotected mrap vehicles are still in operation with the iraqi security forces in early 2020 and most units undertake nontactical movements and even clearance operations in unarmored pickups and lightly armored hummers with no road clearance activities and no counterradio controlled ied jamming equipment135 iraqi troops lack personal protective equipment136 and often suffer preventable deaths through a lack of field surgical capabilities137 field fortifications such as observation posts and vehicle checkpoints are often decrepit lacking concrete hardcover and berms and thus highly vulnerable to direct fire138 iraqi troops increasingly rely on static infrared camera masts to surveil terrain at night but these masts are easily destroyed139 most important the march 2020 removal of us advisors from frontline headquarters such as k1 qayyarah140 taquddum141 kisik and mosul will make it much harder to synergize coalition intelligence and aerial strikes with iraqi operations142 development of the iraqi security forces is deteriorating at exactly the moment it needs to be accelerating and adapting in an area such as kirkuk where this study links the surge of usiraqi joint operations to significant reduction in islamic state attacks the positive trend could be reversed restoring one of the historic engines of islamic state attacks to their effort in 2020 as one senior us officer fresh from duty in iraq told the authors on the national recovery of the islamic state “if caught early by the iraqi security forces this can still be nipped in the bud if they tackle it too late it could get enough momentum to get away from them”143 the covid19 crisis completes this perfect storm for iraq which is also a perfect opportunity for the islamic state relatively cut off from society relatively small in number and already ‘socially distancing’ in rural shelters with very little connection to iran where there has been a large outbreak islamic state members are arguably the iraqis best placed to avoid the ravages of the virus144 bp iraq’s security forces have been more seriously affected145 bq in part due to the covidrelated removal of most nonus trainers from the international coalitionbr the severe oil price crash which began in march 2020 and which is likely to extend through 2021bs imposes yet more strain on the the administrations in baghdad and erbil which may eventually prove a further distraction to the security forces both in terms of maintaining civil order in cities and due to disruption of the wages of security force members and negative effects on their familiesbt defense spending will undoubtedly decline in the coming years as iraq faces a very deep recession in the authors’ view the endogenous factors that draw the most international attention—usiran tensions and covid19—are merely accelerants of an islamic state recovery in iraq that was already well underway in late 2019bu further boosted by the new conditions in 2020 the islamic state may enjoy unexpectedly favorable conditions in which to continue—or even accelerate—its recovery it may become easier for the islamic state to portray itself—in some places quite accurately—as the strongest and wealthiest local security actor which is a proven route to boost recruitment in early 2020 the islamic state is a shadow of its old self in iraq—still a third as potent as it was in 2013 or 2017—but metrics analysis suggests it has recovered to a solid 2012level of attack activities today’s insurgency is almost exclusivelybv rural in contrast to its 2012 iteration but the islamic state could return to urban masscasualty attacks if it builds strong enough bases in the rural ‘belts’ of major citiesbw such as baghdad mosul ramadi and fallujah to name

iraq in the middle months of 2019 coincident with the relocation of iraq cadres following the fall of the last islamic state territorial holdings in syria in early 2019 b all incident data is drawn from the authors’ geolocated significant action sigact dataset the dataset brings together declassified coalition sigact data plus private security company and opensource sigact data used to supplement and extend the dataset as coalition incident collection degraded in 20092011 and was absent in 20122014 new data since 2014 has been added to the dataset to bring it up to date as of the end of march 2020 the dataset includes nonduplicative inputs from open source reporting diplomatic security data private security company incident data iraqi incident data and us government inputs the author adopted the same conservative standard as was used in prior attack metric studies to produce comparable results the dataset was scoured manually including individual consideration of every sigact in the set with the intention of filtering out incidents that are probably not related to islamic state activity such as murders and this is achieved by applying a highly selective filter in areas where criminality is as or more likely than islamic state action such as baghdad city and many other urban environments this process includes expansive weedingout of “legacy ied” incidents caused by explosive remnants of war and exclusion of likely factional and criminal incidents including all incidents in baghdad city the dataset also tries to include only enemyinitiated ie islamic state not shia militia actions and filters out sigacts that appear to be security forceinitiated actions meaning security force raids that result in combat a difficult coding issue relates to security force encounters with explosive devices during patrols which are included as a form of enemyinitiated action and which will be discussed below as a result readers should note that the presented attack numbers are not only a partial sample of islamic state attacks because some incidents are not reported but are also a conservative undercounting of low visibility islamic state incidents for instance because some urban criminal activity may in fact be islamic state racketeering the dataset includes numerous subcategories of attacks such as smallarms fire improvised explosive device indirect fire driveby shooting and so on to qualify as an attack the action must be started but may not necessarily be completed as intended which would be very difficult to judge thus a suicide bomber detonating at a checkpoint would count as an attack but one who selfdetonated during a raid would not count further methodological notes on the refinement of the dataset are included in other footnotes below c

present at the site i inferred in the author’s dataset by connecting the target type with circumstantial details of the attack to eliminate the likelihood that the individual was not the intended victim of the attack as noted baghdad city has been excluded from the dataset and a heavy filter is applied to most urban areas and areas known to suffer high levels of criminal ethnosectarian and militia murders for instance kirkuk and tuz khurmatu cities if the area or target has seen similar islamic state assassinations the sigact stands a better chance of being counted in the islamic state attack metrics used in this study the authors have endeavored to exclude apparent revenge attacks on suspected islamic state members by iraqi tribes which are common j defined in the author’s dataset as ied attacks on static locations that are assessed as being intended to cause 10 or more civilian or security force casualties this excludes most roadside bombings which target vehicles with lower capacity than 10 persons k the un analytical support and sanctions monitoring team noted that the islamic state had “begun to reassert itself in both the syrian arab republic and iraq mounting

arms fire ie sniping attacks per month in diyala ar like diyala baghdad and salah aldin see some specifically antishia attack patterns particularly around the time of shia pilgrimages such as ashura

insurgents tethered to a specific operating area cells may comprise multiple raid teams ied teams and mortar crews often bedding down in separate locations these cells vary substantially in size though a strippeddown platoon around 2025 insurgents seems to mark the upper limit in size for current islamic state cells urban cells are more compact and usually seem to number less than half a dozen operatives bf this figure is derived from the authors’ assessment of the number of active attack cells combined with a calculation of the manpower needed to maintain the operational tempo and volume attacks generated by each individual cell throughout the period covered by this study this requires making educated assumptions about cell size and the number and type of cells operating in different areas the authors’ assumptions about cell size around nine persons for assassination and raiding cells eight for ied crews and seven for mortar or command teams are informed by historic review of insurgent operations in iraq and indications from raid and coalition airstrike data the authors also conducted an extensive review of the islamic state’s published propaganda imagery showcasing individual cell operations and pledges of bayat loyalty during late 2019 when numerous cells gathered their members together to pledge allegiance to the group’s new leader after identifying 47 apparent operational areas for islamic state attack activity the authors then ascribed the presence of absence or different types of cell within the areas for instance in areas with recurring mortar attacks the authors can safely assume there is an indirect fire cell with similar assumptions possible for roadside bombing cells undervehicle bombing cells urban assassination cells and rural raiding cells some areas might have some but not all types of cell ie raiding and roadside bomb but not indirect fire while some areas might have multiples of a type all areas are assumed to have a command cell a 25person intelligence complement and a 25person support complement undertaking support jobs such as driving moving equipment and weapons caches cooking buying materials bomb making and maintaining equipment in total this rough calculation yields a fielded attack force throughout iraq of 1290 fighters which the authors have rounded off to 1300 to underline its approximate nature these insights are based on qualitative insights from the authors’ dataset with attention to both attack data and nonattack data such as raids airstrikes and other indicators of cell location composition and strength these figures are clearly approximate and are intended to give the authors’ sense of the likely scale of the insurgent manpower base bg the calculation of 2700 active support operatives is very approximate and based on a simple premise that for every fighter in the field there are another two undertaking support jobs to service the whole area these include logistical and financial operatives enforcement and other support personnel collecting taxes probably takes up a dedicated subelement of each area’s support operatives the twotoone ratio 1300 x 2 gives 2600 which the authors have rounded up to 2700 to include some nationallevel leadership the tally can easily be adjusted by the reader if they prefer a higher or lower toothtotail ratio these figures are clearly approximate and are intended to give the authors’ sense of the likely scale of the insurgent manpower base bh based on the authors’ working assumption that 2000 of the 4000 combatant members are family household heads while the other 2000 are single men and that these have family sizes of five adult relatives excluding the household head in their homes this household size assumption is based on longstanding study of iraqi society and insurgency thus 2000 household heads have access to a support network of 10000 adults bi in the urban clearance operations at raqqa hajin and baghouz the us

345,tax notes reporters alexis gravely and jonathan curry discuss us tax policy following the 2020 presidential election and tax notes senior reporter paul jones talks about the results of state tax ballot measures this post has been edited for length and clarity david stewart welcome to the podcast im david stewart editor in chief of tax notes today international  this week election aftermath with former vice president and now presidentelect joe biden heading to the white house in january were going to take a look at what a change in administration means for us tax policy back in september i spoke with tax notes reporters alexis gravely and jonathan curry about each of the presidential candidates tax plans now theyre both back to discuss the last two months of president trumps term and what we can expect from the incoming biden administration later on well hear from tax notes senior reporter paul jones about the outcome of some taxrelated ballot measures across the us but first alexis jonathan welcome back to the podcast alexis gravely thanks for having me jonathan curry its great to be back dave more for you what does a biden presidency mean for your tax bill back to office work with or without a covid19 vaccine irs threatens 75 fraud penalty for investors in syndicated conservation easements david stewart before we get started id like to note that were recording this on wednesday november 11 which is to say that election results have not yet been certified but joe biden is projected to have secured an electoral college victory alexis can you briefly remind us what were some of the big tax policy ideas biden put forth as a candidate alexis gravely the crux of bidens tax plan is that corporations and those making over 400000 need their taxes increased those could come in the form of a higher corporate tax rate a higher rate for the top individual income tax bracket and also taxing capital gains the same as ordinary income those were just a few of the things that he proposed as revenue raisers there are plenty more that revenue would be used to pay for other parts of his platform for those making less than 400000 biden has insisted that their taxes wont go up that appears to be true at least not anytime soon some models have predicted that middleincome tax payers would end up shouldering part of the burden of an increased corporate tax rate but the tax policy center for example doesnt project that would happen until around 2030 in the meantime biden has proposed a number of tax credits for low and middleincome folks to help out with things like child care healthcare and housing david stewart biden has said that his top priority for this new presidency is handling the coronavirus has he mentioned any tax policy tools to combat the pandemic or the current economic downturn alexis gravely explicitly there hasnt really been a lot there in midseptember he added to his platform a proposal to expand the child tax credit and make it refundable for the duration of the pandemic thats already been passed by house democrats in the health and economic recovery omnibus emergency solutions heroes act he was just sort of signing onto it by adding it to his platform as far as i know thats really the only specific reference that hes made to tax policy and covid19 i checked out his transition document and that lays out his plans for covid19 and the economy it doesnt say things like were going to use tax credits to do x y and z but some of what hes listed on his agenda could be accomplished using tax policy because some of the things have been mentioned before for example in his agenda he has this part which says provide a restart package that helps small businesses cover the cost of operating safely including things like plexiglass and personal protective equipment ppe to me that sounds similar to something that house republicans proposed in legislation they introduced at the end of october theirs was a healthy workplace tax credit and it would essentially do the same thing it would provide a refundable credit for businesses to use on those covid19 mitigation expenses i think if we see some of bidens agenda items turn into actual legislation well be able to see more clearly how his plans for the pandemic and tax policy can intersect and be intertwined david stewart as biden has begun to roll out his transition team have we learned anything about the tax people who might be involved in the new administration jonathan curry one of the key members of his transition team for treasury is lily batchelder shes currently a new york university law professor she has written about a lot of subjects in the tax world but shes especially known as a thought leader when it comes to taxing the wealthy i think it will be interesting to see if and how that tax the rich angle is imprinted on bidens tax team david stewart as of today theres a strong possibility of biden coming into divided government upon inauguration with democrats controlling the house and republicans controlling the senate last time we spoke alexis you said that you were optimistic that biden could pass some of his tax plans given his long history in the senate do you still feel that way alexis gravely admittedly i am feeling a little less optimistic i think part of the reason is because since we last spoke weve seen congress unable to come together and deliver covid19 relief a lot of economists have been saying for the last several months that that relief is essential in my view if they arent able to pass something thats deemed necessary and they arent able to do it in a bipartisan manner then i cant see them coming together to do something like raise taxes which republicans are almost certainly not going to be fans of thats not to say that we arent going to see any tax legislation for the next four years a lot of folks have been pointing out that some of the tax policy changes made in the tax cuts and jobs act are set to begin at the end of 2021 and into 2022 a lot of those builtin changes are tax increases there are most likely going to be lawmakers who arent going to view these changes as ideal especially if the economy is still recovering we could see a bipartisan push to reform or stop them from going into effect but is biden going to get to raise the corporate income tax rate on day one i dont think thats going to happen david stewart lets turn to president trumps final two months in office jonathan what do you expect to see if anything from the white house in terms of tax policy or any sort of changes between now and inauguration day are we likely to get some sort of coronavirus package jonathan curry my crystal ball is telling me no sadly back in october trump put the kibosh on negotiations over a coronavirus relief package and effectively ruled out any preelection action on that front at the time though he did promise that a deal was going to get done right after the election where things stand now it kind of seems that in his mind the election isnt really over i just dont expect theres going to be a lot of bandwidth for negotiating a deal in the current environment we do have tax extenders expiring at the end of the year but congress has a habit of waiting until those have already expired to really get down to bothering with them i dont really see a whole lot of tax action within the next few weeks david stewart when you were here in september you talked about this executive memorandum trump signed about payroll taxes can you remind our listeners about that jonathan curry the payroll tax deferral in my mind its basically the 2020 of tax policy it was bizarre and totally unexpected in august negotiations with congress over a big coronavirus relief package had been stalled president trump decided to get the ball rolling with some unilateral executive action one of the ways that they decided to do that was through an executive order to defer the withholding and payment of the employee share payroll taxes which is about 62 percent the actual memo itself that trump issued was pretty vague it just said that the deferral period would last from september 1 through december 31 and that it would apply to employees earning less than 4000 biweekly but overall the white house punted to treasury to let them fill in the details of how its all going to work the idea behind it though was that they were going to defer those taxes now and then kind of twist congresss arm and force them to forgive the taxes on the back end but where things stand now congress doesnt really seem to be showing much sign of playing ball on that for now its just a deferral those deferred taxes are going to be due between january 1 and april 30 of next year after that if you havent paid it back penalties and interest start accruing david stewart with biden taking over the white house in january what happens to this memorandum jonathan curry it does seem to have been more of a political move and not a practical one the businesses on the hook administratively for withholding these payroll taxes said this would be an administrative nightmare and that it was basically unworkable to my knowledge very few businesses in the private sector actually took the white house up on this offer although i would love to see numbers on that one day but the deferral did go into effect automatically for federal government employees and the military theyll have to reckon with that itd be interesting to see if federal employee unions decide to put pressure on the biden administration saying we need help to forgive this itll be interesting to see what happens at the moment biden has been critical of the payroll tax deferral memo that trump issued i dont see a lot of movement so far to forgive them david stewart looking back over the last four years what would you say is trumps tax legacy jonathan curry on tax its definitely the tcja youll probably have noted by now that these are regularly called the trump tax cuts theyre not called the mcconnell tax cuts or the paul ryan tax cuts in my mind the tcja really is emblematic of trumps overall approach to governing from these past four years number one it was big he got republicans to ditch revenueneutral tax reform which was sort of the gold standard of tax reform that was always kind of eluding lawmakers they ended up with a nearly 2 trillion tax cut instead it was marked by huge promises and exaggeration trump and his advisors were talking frequently about how the tax cuts would pay for themselves with extra economic growth and that economic growth would explode wed have economic growth rates of four or five or even 6 percent gdp each year which didnt happen it was also very partisan as soon as they ditched revenue neutrality the idea that thered be any democratic support was effectively tossed in the trash finally it was and continues to be somewhat of a chaotic law the legislation was rushed through at the end of 2017 it showed in the fact that there was the need for technical corrections plus a ton of guidance from treasury to fill in the blanks also for procedural reasons many of its provisions are set to expire or phase out in the coming years the chaos of passing the law is going to rear its head again in a couple of years thats going to cause quite a few huge political battles david stewart this has been fascinating alexis jonathan thanks for being here alexis gravely of course happy to be on the show jonathan curry thanks dave its been a pleasure david stewart now well turn to what happened with state ballot measures across the us please note that we recorded this on monday november 9 some of the vote tallies may have changed joining me now by phone from his home in california is tax notes senior reporter paul jones paul welcome back to the podcast paul jones thanks its good to be here david stewart what sort of issues went before the voters in the states this year paul jones there were a whole range of issues it really ran the gamut we had proposals to create progressive income taxes we had proposals to increase accountability for how tax dollars are spent we saw efforts to provide more tax breaks in a couple of states to veterans or their spouses plus of course there were efforts to increase taxes on tobacco and vaping a couple of states have approved measures to legalize and tax recreational marijuana david stewart lets start off with one of the more talked about taxrelated ballot measures californias proposition 15 whats in that proposal where do things stand today paul jones proposition 15 was a pretty ambitious proposal and the proponents of it worked on it for a couple of years but it looks like it was killed by voters by about 52 percent to 48 percent california obviously has a property tax law on the books proposition 13 which i think is pretty well known that restricts taxation of property including by assessing properties based on their latest value at sale with a small upward adjustment each year commercial properties are subject to that as well as residential properties critics of proposition 13 whove argued that its negatively affected the states ability to fund services such as education argued that commercial properties should be taxed based on their fair market value their current value and not under the rules originally set by proposition 13 for several years theyve been pushing for some sort of a splitroll proposal in 2018 they got a ballot measure qualified set it for the 2020 election and then decided to tweak it so they had to get a completely separate ballot initiative pretty similar to the one that they had already qualified for the ballot that was what went before voters november 3 you had educators the states democratic party a lot of public sector unions progressive groups all pushing for this measure they were hoping that if commercial properties worth over 3 million or whose owners had more than 3 million worth of commercial holdings in the state that if those properties were taxed at their fair market value it would generate about 12 billion that was sort of the upper tier estimate — about 12 billion more for education and local governments in the state but it was defeated again 52 percent opposed to 48 percent in favor after all of this energy and effort i think it really just indicates that proposition 13 continues to have a real hold in california its been over 40 years since proposition 13 passed this was targeted at businesses and commercial properties theres still this strong resistance in the state to modifying that opponents obviously included tax watchdogs one of them the howard jarvis taxpayers association is one of the guardians of prop 13s legacy they were arguing this would potentially hurt small businesses that have to rent commercial property to operate and that costs would be passed on to consumers theyre pretty satisfied i spoke with jon coupal the president of the howard jarvis taxpayers association last week he said that hed used this as a sort of reconfirming that voters support prop 13 david stewart turning to state income taxes i understand that illinois and arizona both weighed in on changes and got differing results can you tell us a little about that paul jones what happened in arizona isnt necessarily surprising but it is notable the states public education system received a lot of cuts after the 2008 recession and that money was never quite restored the state has approved increases for education within the past couple of years but educators have argued that it doesnt provide sufficient funding or pay to teachers it therefore has a very difficult time attracting and retaining really wellqualified educators they had been pushing for a couple of years now to increase taxes on higher earners in 2018 they got a ballot measure on the ballot with sufficient signatures but it was taken to court because opponents argued that it was described in a misleading way the arizona supreme court agreed and took that off the ballot this year they got proposition 208 approved for the ballot and opponents again sued but this time the state supreme court upheld it and kept it on the ballot now it looks like voters have passed it this would impose a 35 percent income tax surcharge on income over 250000 for individuals and over 500000 for joint filers that essentially is an increase from 45 percent being the top income tax rate per state to 8 percent for that income thats a pretty significant increase this is a major win for educators and progressives in arizona arizona is obviously not a state thats known for being particularly progressive when it comes to tax matters gov doug ducey r has actually run on a pledge that he wouldnt increase taxes the decision by voters to approve this i think again it was about 52 percent in favor to 48 percent opposed i think this really indicates that the proponents of proposition 208 made their case to voters that they need more funding for education and notably that it should come from higher earners the opponents are arguing that this is going to hurt the states economy its going to make it less attractive to wealthier residents well have to see if that pans out there was polling showing the prop 208 was going to pass but it is still notable that arizona has decided to support this measure in my opinion moving on to illinois this is also interesting in illinois gov jb pritzker d was pushing hard for a constitutional amendment to allow progressive income taxation in the state in fact the legislature had already approved a bill that was going to establish six tiers if voters approved that constitutional amendment our reporter aaron davis has been covering that closely hes gotten very good coverage of that it was people earning over 250000 who were going to actually see an income tax increase this fight was in part between pritzker and another billionaire ken griffin there was a billionaire versus billionaire dynamic to this measures race ultimately about 55 percent of voters voted in opposition to this despite a warning by pritzker that without this they were going to have to make deep cuts make a general increase to the flat income tax or find billions of dollars that they were hoping would come in through approval of a progressive income tax voters still decided that they didnt want make this significant change and allow for progressive income taxation in the state david stewart another ballot measure that we saw was kind of an interesting one out of alaska where there was a plan to increase taxes on production at three legacy oil fields on the north slope region whats happening up there paul jones that was alaskas ballot measure 1 i think it was about 65 percent had voted against it as of the last tally and 35 percent had voted in favor of it that measure was really backed by some of the former officials with gov bill walker the previous independent governor some of the people in his administration and some democrats in the state their interest was to increase taxes on particularly some of these larger companies that own areas in the legacy fields of the north slope they wanted to increase their production taxes the state of alaska has had deficits for years now the lower price of oil has really hit it hard its even had to figure out ways to take some of the earnings from its sovereign wealth fund in order to balance budget in addition to cuts some of the moderate to progressives in the state have looked at for a couple of years now this idea of going after oil companies for a little bit more revenue during walkers administration they actually reduced a lot of the incentives for oil companies including ending cash payments for certain credits that would be paid to oil companies for exploration now there was this effort to try and actually go after major producers and just generally increase taxes on them it just didnt take with voters as i said as of the last tally was about 65 percent in opposition the states chamber of commerce the alaska oil and gas association and major oil companies all spent an enormous amount of money opposing this their argument was this will make alaska less attractive to these companies not just because it would increase taxes on some of the major companies there in addition alaska has been making changes to its oil tax regime not regularly but frequently they were claiming that this is creating an image of an unstable business environment for oil companies i think given how dependent alaska is on oil that resonated with voters and they decided just not to tinker with that regime any further david stewart i suppose we cant talk about state tax ballot measures without recognizing what appears to be a growing trend toward legalizing and taxing recreational marijuana by ballot measure what sort of changes have we seen this year paul jones weve seen a number of states approve marijuana there were several that approved medical marijuana going back to arizona we also saw voters approve proposition 207 that would apply i think a 16 percent tax on the retail price of marijuana in the state montana voters also opted to legalize recreational pot that was i think by about a 57 percent in favor vote margin that will apply a tax of 20 percent rate new jersey also legalized recreational marijuana as did south dakota it seems like as more and more states have legalized marijuana recreational marijuana or medical marijuana theres this effect that its becoming easier and easier to convince people that its worth a try of course the proponents of legal marijuana also argue that this will generate significant revenue that can be used to fund general operations and also specifically efforts to help people dealing with addiction to marijuana and sometimes also other substances as well it does seem like theres sort of an ongoing trend here of state voters being more and more receptive to the idea that the best approach to dealing with marijuana is to legalize it and then also tax it in order to use that revenue to address some of the negative effects of marijuana and again other substances as well david stewart paul i thank you very much for being here paul jones its always a pleasure thanks tax notes staff,3

342,most preretirees haven’t saved enough money to retire full time at age 65 and enjoy their preretirement level of spendable income according to a recent report from the stanford center on longevity instead they’ll either need to work longer reduce their spending or do some combination of the two more from forbes boomers retirement reality requires careful planning by steve vernon this conclusion assumes that to be comfortable you’ll need to meet a common retirement planning goal that you’ll need a gross retirement income equal to 70 to 80 of your preretirement pay why not 100 when you’re retired you’ll most likely need less gross income because you won’t pay as much toward income and fica taxes you won’t need to save for retirement anymore and you won’t have to pay for workrelated expenses such as commuting if you haven’t saved enough to meet the 70 to 80 replacement goal there’s no need to panic or get depressed about your future instead try changing your retirement objectives it’s pointless to strive for an unrealistic goal that requires more money than you have rather than having pieinthesky plans a more helpful strategy might be to decide that you simply want to live a fulfilled and happy life during your retirement years then you can decide how much money you really need to be fulfilled and whether you can still be happy if you need to work during some of your retirement years let’s take a deeper look at these two decisions more for you this is why the millennials’ singles lifestyle may be on a collision course with caregiving  retirement this is why you should know about market rotation right now how much should you withdraw from retirement savings annually can you spend less and still be happy the common 70 to 80 retirement goal assumes that in retirement you’re basically continuing the life you had while you were working this means you’ll need the same amount of money to spend that you had during your working years but if you can’t afford that life it might be time to rethink what is “just enough” money to meet your basic living expenses and be happy more from forbes the question many preretirees and retirees will need to answer by steve vernon a good place to start is to reexamine your most costly basic living expenses which typically include housing and transportation to save money you might consider downsizing your house in the process you might better meet your needs in retirement such as by moving to a smaller house that requires less upkeep or by living closer to friends and family another savings area to consider is transportation maybe you could drive a less expensive car walk or bike more or use public transportation to get where you need to go more from forbes dont make this costly retirement planning mistake by steve vernon you’ll also want to look at your “wants” vs your needs to see if they really support your goal to be happy and fulfilled in retirement there could very well be less expensive ways to live a life that makes you happy can you work during your retirement years and still be happy for many people an underlying often unspoken assumption is that there are much better things you could do with your time than to work and that you should retire as soon as you can but this assumption overlooks the fact that working provides us with many nonfinancial benefits including friends social contacts and a reason to get up in the morning and don’t forget the obvious financial benefits more money to spend and possibly valuable medical insurance of course there could be serious disadvantages to your current working situation your work might be stressful or unhealthy you might be tired of working so hard or you’re bored and want to try something new however retiring completely from the work force might not be the best way to address these challenges particularly if you haven’t saved enough money to stop working instead it might be more realistic to find different work that addresses these challenges most work situations have their advantages and disadvantages to sort out these considerations for yourself write down all the benefits you realize by working both financial and nonfinancial then write down the disadvantages then think about how you can maintain the advantages and reduce the disadvantages either by shifting your current work situation or by looking for new work by thinking smarter you can overcome any discouragement you might have about your financial situation for retirement refocusing your retirement goals on your life and your happiness rather than on your money can be a powerful strategy that can actually make your money work better for you you can do it steve vernon i am the president of restoflife communications and a

either worked with hill or are close to her her time as special assistant to the president and senior director for european and russian affairs a role that put her at the center of domestic and geopolitical intrigue follows the arc of the russiagate scandal that dogged trump’s presidency almost from its inception  since her departure that scandal has been replaced by a new one hill resigned her post just seven days before trump made a fateful call to ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky a conversation that has embroiled him in a deepening impeachment inquiry her story as an unlikely trump adviser examined in depth for the first time here is emblematic of the tension facing so many national security experts between their personal ambitions and their sense of duty hill’s sense that she might be fired at any moment never quite subsided — in part because she was such a surprising pick in the first place a sober critic of vladimir putin — she described the russian strongman just months before her appointment to the national security council as motivated to meddle in the us presidential election and fond of “blackmail and intimidation” — hill also hailed from the brookings institution the epitome of the dc establishment trump had pointedly rejected and she was recruited by kt mcfarland and michael flynn who were out as trump’s top two national security officials before hill even formally started she had even worked with christopher steele the british exspymaster behind the salacious dossier that rocked the early days of trump’s presidency national security insiders were shocked when she took the job—she was anything but a trump loyalist her colleagues weren’t even sure whether she was a conservative and the trumprussia probe was gaining steam and in the headlines daily but hill earlier this month officially departed the administration on good terms having helped craft responses to russia’s malign behavior that to many experts are arguably even tougher than those imposed by the obama administration—including the expulsion of 60 undercover russian intelligence officers from the us following a russian chemical weapons attack on british soil the provision of lethal weapons to ukraine and a us troop buildup in poland and she did it by following a playbook that has become familiar to nonloyalist administration officials hoping to survive in their jobs pick your battles stay out of the news and understand that sometimes the wins are as prosaic as stabilizing an erratic adversarial relationship and reassuring allies “she understands as well as anyone what drives and constrains russian policy under vladimir putin” said mcmaster trump’s second national security adviser and during her time in the white house mcmaster added hill “set conditions for better relations should putin and those around him realize that their sustained campaign to undermine the united states and the west is backfiring and harming the russian people  before joining the white house hill seemed to underestimate how well trump and putin would get along “we’re going to have an awful lot of friction with russia and trump isn’t exactly the most diplomatic of people” she told the atlantic after trump was elected “so i imagine he’ll fall out with his new friend vladimir pretty quickly” such a falling out hasn’t happened — and despite her skepticism of putin and belief that a “reset” with russia is unattainable hill came to view trump’s desire to forge a working relationship with the kremlin and anchor the relationship in a longterm arms control treaty as a fundamentally good instinct  still current and former officials acknowledge privately that even with the expertise and experience hill brought to the white house the administration has no coherent foreign policy let alone a unified strategy for dealing with putin — forging a new arms control treaty with moscow while deterring russia’s influence operations in the us for example remain steep uphill battles and the recently fired john bolton mcmaster’s replacement wasn’t exactly an empowering boss “she wasn’t sitting around with bolton debating what policies to implement” said a former nsc official who’s worked with hill “and she hints at the fact that she doesn’t know what’s going on sometimes damage control is really her purview”  in the trump era that’s hardly a minor role  “things certainly could’ve been a lot worse if fiona weren’t there” said another longtime russia expert and friend of hill’s “but even if she could make a positive change and get away with it because the president maybe isn’t fully focused on it at that moment ultimately it’s going to be undone by what he says and does privately” trump’s tendency to rely more on his instincts than his advisers was initially anxietyinducing his offthecuff chats with foreign leaders and public comments — whether chastising us spies dismissing nato as “obsolete” or questioning the value of the european union—often undermined his own national security advisers’ positions one notorious phone call to kiev aside perhaps hill and the broader team began to view trump’s private musings with world leaders with less alarm once they realized they rarely resulted in actual policy shifts two particularly fanciful trump ideas — a joint cyber initiative with moscow the president proposed on twitter in 2017 for example and the russians’ offer to “help” interrogate americans on us soil last year — were never seriously considered by the white house sources said “one of trump’s favorite things to say to putin is ‘i’ll have my guys look into it” said a former trump national security official who attended their bilateral meetings “but much to the russians’ frustration he rarely if ever actually does they think they’re getting concessions but they’re really just getting hot air”   hill meanwhile is an intense academic whose deliberateness can best be characterized as the complete opposite of trump’s streamofconsciousness style — a product perhaps of her workingclass upbringing and desire to distinguish herself in a field dominated by men  born into a family of coal miners in northern england in 1965 hill was deeply affected by the donbass miners strike in 1989—the first major strike in soviet history in what is now eastern ukraine she went on to become a scholar of russian history earning her master’s degree in soviet studies from harvard in 1991 where she also met her future husband she became a dual ukus citizen after they married after completing her phd in history and working in the research department at harvard’s kennedy school of government she joined the national intelligence council as national intelligence officer for russia and eurasia in 2006  fluent in russian hill has been studying putin since he came to power nearly two decades ago like many eurasia hands at the time hill was initially receptive to putin’s selfbranding as a nononsense leader who sought to rebuild the russian state after its postsoviet collapse she seemed particularly impressed with the exkgb agent’s diplomatic chops “stop blaming putin and start helping him” she wrote in a 2004 oped on the heels of a meeting putin held with a western delegation to discuss countering chechen terrorists but she soon became what her friends and colleagues describe as a russia “realist” in 2013 nearly a decade after urging the west to try to work with putin and roughly a year before russia forcibly annexed crimea from ukraine hill wrote that putin “has never seen the west as a model for russia now he is not even interested in joining it as a partner”  from her perch at brookings hill urged the obama administration to go into its socalled russian reset with eyes wide open and criticized the policy as somewhat unrealistic  “the reality is this there are no big deals to be had with putin” she wrote along with coauthor cliff gaddy “outside the traditional usrussian bilateral realm of arms control there is no great opportunity for the obama administration in russia the only quid pro quo putin would likely strike with the united states is one no administration could or would contemplate—where moscow agrees not to make life too difficult for washington as long as the us ignores russian domestic developments and human rights abuses”  four years later hill found herself working in an administration that withdrew from its chief arms control deal with moscow and regularly ignores russia’s crackdown on free speech and dissent—joining some others who entered the administration with backgrounds and worldviews that seemed deeply at odds with those of the president who repeatedly extolled putin as a “strong” leader and seemed eager to work with him  those include mary kissel a mike pompeo adviser who as a wall street journal opinion writer tweeted about trump’s “frightening ignorance” and criticized his approach on syria and china and elliott abrams a special envoy overseeing policy toward venezuela who wrote during the 2016 election that trump “should not be president of the united states” james jeffrey a special envoy dealing with syria policy considered himself a “never trumper” before joining the administration last year hill never criticized trump so overtly and bolton who succeeded mcmaster as national security adviser in march 2018 and was ousted earlier this month resisted pressure from the more hardline loyalist factions of the white house to fire her when he was appointed but she entered the white house with a particularly heavy piece of baggage that either didn’t bother trump or never crossed his radar a former working relationship with steele according to people familiar with their relationship the two british russia hands are not exactly friends but they have known each other for years beginning when hill was working on russia at the national intelligence council and steele was on mi6’s russia desk  “she had a high opinion of steele and thought he was very smart” a foreign policy veteran and one of hill’s close friends told politico hill spoke to steele in 2016 and discussed him with friends in 2017 after buzzfeed published his memos outlining a potential conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia to win the election  hill told mcmaster “as soon as she was hired” that she knew steele and had worked with him in the past according to a former nsc official but she confided in some that she wasn’t in a position to judge whether the former spy’s assessments were accurate and even thought steele might have been played by the russians into spreading disinformation trump’s display in helsinki in 2018 meanwhile led many to conclude that steele’s report was more accurate than not in the news conference that followed his private meeting with putin trump sided with the russians over the us intelligence community’s assessment that moscow had waged an allout attack on the 2016 election and seemed to entertain putin’s offer to “help” interrogate americans on us soil — including barack obama’s former ambassador to russia michael mcfaul — about the russia probe the joint news conference which hill had been dreading and urged trump’s advisers to cancel cemented fears among some that trump was in putin’s pocket and prompted bipartisan backlash and hill was flooded with calls and emails urging her to resign in protest  she never seriously considered stepping down though according to a person familiar with her thinking because the news conference didn’t reflect the substantive issues like arms control and terrorism that were discussed in the leaders’ bilateral meeting the one where us officials were present anyway still she was rebuked internally when she later met with mcfaul a fierce and frequent trump critic to hear his concerns about the administration’s handling of the episode  “that was the one time” hill got a bit too close to politics the person said  still she bounced back—and her views were always nuanced enough that she was never seen as impeding the kind of improved relationship with russia that trump wanted a former nsc official recalled an episode in which russia’s national security adviser nikolai patrushev wanted to meet with mcmaster but faced enormous pushback by the state department and pentagon “fiona on the other hand was very supportive of mcmaster maintaining that channel” the former official said “she understands the role that patrushev plays and that he’s more important in the russian hierarchy than say foreign minister lavrov so that’s also why she encouraged that dialogue”  but it wasn’t always the russians hill had to worry about when she tried unsuccessfully earlier this spring to prevent hungarian prime minister viktor orban from meeting with trump — hill thought the farright nationalist shouldn’t be welcomed at the white house — orban sympathizers waged “an allout war of intimidation on her” threatening her and calling her home multiple times a day a former official said the attacks subsided only after she asked the hungarian embassy to intervene now current and former intelligence officials national security experts and foreign policy veterans fear hill’s departure has left a gaping hole in expertise at the white house at a moment when russia’s ongoing efforts to interfere in the 2020 election require a wholeofgovernment response hill has been replaced by tim morrison an arms control expert and bolton loyalist who has been described as a “nuclear superhawk” — a logical choice given trump’s fixation with nuclear weapons but not hill’s first choice  morrison has big shoes to fill among european officials who had been able to count on hill for reassurance that they wouldn’t be abandoned by the us despite trump’s threatening rhetoric “fiona’s door has always been open to the europeans” said karen donfried president of the german marshall fund and a longtime friend of hill “she was seen as approachable by our european interlocutors”  she “comforts” them too said another former nsc official who worked with hill from maintaining us support for the three seas initiative — a dialogue of 12 central and eastern european states in the eu — to pushing for the us to play an important role in penalizing russia for a chemical weapons attack on british soil in 2018 hill “has always stood firm in terms of her policy recommendations” the former official said that consistency has reassured european partners that there is some coherence to the white house’s foreign policy one veteran us diplomat who has known hill for years said hill and her team “regarded themselves as people with the responsibility to do the right thing — not to undermine the president but try to take his better instincts and turn them into something constructive and they succeeded to the point where i’ve told european diplomats critical of this administration’s russia policies that they’re gonna look back on fiona’s time at the white house as the good old days”  california   by jeremy b white   updated 050820 0944 pm edt   by sam sutton and carly sitrin    by bill mahoney and josh gerstein   updated

53,main menu michael knights  share via     abstract kata’ib hezbollah was iran’s most favored militant group in iraq from its formation in the mid2000s until the death of its founder abu mahdi almuhandis on january 3 2020 yet the activities and influence of almuhandis and kh were not synonymous as has been shown since his death kh is still the engine room of antius attacks in iraq but it is less politically agile and operates in a more hostile counterterrorism environment where deniability and secrecy have become more important again the islamic revolutionary guard corps quds force is also leaning on a more diversified model in iraq drawing on nonkh factions like saraya aljihad and saraya alashura and engaging more directly with iraq’s minorities including sunni communities and the shia kurdish faylis and turkmen history may be repeating itself as iran develops new smaller and more secure iraqi cells that are reminiscent of the formation of kata’ib hezbollah itself kata’ib hezbollah kh is at the forefront of us threat assessments due to an increasing drumbeat of militia attacks on us interests in iraq and the approaching anniversary of both the december 31 2019 assault on the us embassy in baghdad and the january 3 2020 killing of islamic revolutionary guard corps quds force irgcqf commander qassem soleimani and popular mobilization forces pmf vice chairman abu mahdi almuhandis1 if militias continue to strike us targets washington has threatened to close the embassy and retaliate against tens of militia targets in iraq of which a significant proportion would likely be kh leaders and sites on october 10 2020 general spokesman of kh muhammed mohyee announced a “conditional truce” with us forces in iraq in an effort to reduce political pressure on the movement to cease its attacks which mohyee admitted had been brought to a head by the us threat2 two days later a senior kh leader abu ali alaskari encouraged iraqi militias to continue reconnaissance and preparations to strike american targets in iraq and “zionoamerican” aircraft over iraq if the united states does not withdraw from the country3 the untidy stream of messages originating from different centers within kh these days is one indication that the group is becoming less cohesive and more erratic at this point it is especially valuable to look closer at kh separating myth from reality to the greatest extent possible in the case of such a secretive organization in august 2019 this author concluded that “the central nervous system of irgcqf influence in iraq is abu mahdi almuhandis and kata’ib hezbollah” suggesting a synonymous capability which arguably oversimplified the relationship4 now nearly a year after almuhandis’s death there has been an opportunity to observe kh operating without the benefit of almuhandis’s political topcover in the author’s experience since almuhandis died there has also been a slight openingup of iraqis’s willingness to talk privately on the issue of almuhandis kh and the other fasa’il arabic for armed groups used in iraq to describe the militias that have existed prior to the formation of the pmf some kh leaders have become more visible due to their involvement in the pmf in assaults on the government or in the suppression of protestors this has allowed investigation of almuhandis’s real relationship to kh the parsing of almuhandis’s influence versus kh’s and the assessment of kh’s future role and relations with the irgcqf in an intensive multiyear research effort building on increasingly detailed previous ctc sentinel articles5 the author undertook two interlinked research processes in the 20182020 period first the author visited iraq on six occasions and interviewed over 30 security officials and politicians the conversations were substantive usually over an hour of focused discussion on militia issues and particularly kh the interviewees included very senior politicians many of which were shia leaders with strong ties to irgcqf many were interviewed multiple times with very detailed notes taken all the interviews were undertaken on deep background due to the severe physical security threat posed by militias and great care was taken and is needed in future to ensure that such individuals are not exposed to intimidation for cooperating with researcha alongside facetoface interviews the author also undertook a dense web of communications with iraqi interviewees using secure messaging applications amounting to hundreds of specific information requests to verify data and multisource points of detail as well as secure transfer of large tranches of data and imagery the author used his 16year track record of interviewing iraqis to assess information the below analysis is the product of a synthesized intelligence process this article has been broken into eight sections in part 1 the article will review how kh was formed what niche it filled and what role almuhandis played in forming the movement part 2 looks at the visible impact of almuhandis’s death on kh and part 3 looks at the internal power balance within kh at the time of writing part 4 looks at the significant nonmilitary aspects of the kh family of institutions that survive almuhandis and part 5 describes the geographic focus of kh military forces part 6 looks at the role that kh special operations plays in iranian power projection through missiles and terrorism part 7 looks at the narrow but important part that kh plays in the suppression of protests and other human rights violations part 8 draws together the study’s key findings and suggests the most likely ways that kh other fasa’il and the irgcqf and lebanese hezbollah networks will adapt in the near future part 1 reassessing the timeline almuhandis the fasa’il and kh due to the importance of personal and factional history and relations it is important to start any exploration of the nature of kh and its relationship with almuhandis by going back to the very beginning and taking a fresh look at the history of the movement and its founder the origins of kh are the iraqiformed islamic da’awa party hizb alda’awa alislamiya in arabic and the iranformed supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq or scirib almajlis ala’ala lithawra alislamiyya fi aliraq during the years of opposition to the baathist regime in iraq between 1968 and 2003 da’awa developed its own “mujahideen” covert operations armc working in concert with iranian intelligence the “mujahideen” force undertook a number of terrorist attacks in kuwait in 1983d one of the iraqis accused of involvement and later sentenced to death in absentia by kuwait6 was abu mahdi almuhandis real name jamal ja’far muhammad ali alibrahim7 in parallel to covert operations the islamic revolutionary guard corps irgc developed a conventional military wing for sciri the badr brigade failaq badre that fought against saddamled iraq as part of the irgc order of battle in the iraniraq war abu mahdi almuhandis was the assistant commander of badr by 2002 meaning that he ran daytoday operationsf today’s head of badr hadi alameri was almuhandis’s chief of staff at the time8 mustafa abd’al hamid hussein alotabi also known as abu mustafa alsheibani or hamid thajeel wareij alattabi9 commanded the baghdad “axis” of badr10 and badr’s fourth “division” was commanded11 by abu muntadher alhusseini real name tahseen abid mutar alabboudi today’s pmf operations director12 almuhandis’s experience leading badr—in the war and in guerrilla operations against saddam’s regime afterward—created networks that would later feed recruits to kh and support its operations the ‘incubators’ for special groups in iraq in late 2002 almuhandis took leave from badr seemingly due to his unwillingness to openly work in iraq alongside the united states in a postinvasion scenario13 whether ideologically motivated or due to the risk of arrest for prior terrorist activities almuhandis and alsheibani did not enter iraq with their badr contemporaries in 2003 but instead worked on immediate postwar priorities such as retribution operations against the mujaheddine khalq mek a saddambacked iranian opposition group that was sent into iran to kill badr members14 and against iraqi pilots accused of bombing badr and shia rebelsg almuhandis became an independent mp in the january 2005 elections avoiding us notice until the spring of 2007 by which time he was a secondterm mp having been reelected in the december 2005 elections almuhandis was the liaison with irgcqf and a security advisor to prime minister ibrahim alja’afari during his term from may 2005 to may 2006 the main point of contact between the iraqi fighters and irgc senior commanders like qassem soleimani15 alongside the older soldierstatesman almuhandis the aforementioned abu mustafa alsheibani was the youngerh logistical commander leading what the americans would call “the sheibani network”16 according to multiple wellinformed observers almuhandis should be considered a founding father of most of the anticoalition shia militant groups credited with implementing irgcqf’s uparming of the jaish almahdi jam in the 2004 twin uprisings and later the splinteringoff of asa’ib ahl alhaq aah from the ranks of jam’s hardliners as one interviewee with a closeness to kh suggested “badr was the first incubator … then the mahdi army” ie jam as the quote suggests both badr and jam were used as a recruitment pool for anticoalition networks directed and administered by irgcqf as badr had been since the 1980s formation of kata’ib hezbollah the formal establishment of kh with its prestigious namei and iconography17 modeled on lebanese hezbollahj was driven by a number of developments as hamdi malik has noted irgcqf sought a more disciplined and operationally secure network than jam or aah between december 2006 and september 2007 a new us special operations task force captured a range of irgcqf and special group commanders in iraq18 in the same period almuhandis fled iraq when his identity was publicly revealed and kuwait prosecuted him in absentia for terrorist charges from 198319 alsheibani’s brother was captured by coalition forces in april 200720 and abu mustapha alsheibani was himself designated by the united states as a terrorist in september 200721 the inner circle of the new kh movement were handpicked fighters from five groups abu alfadl alabbas brigadek kata’ib karbala kata’ib zaid ibn ali kata’ib ali alakbar and kata’ib alsajjad22 prior to 2007 these were sometimes referred to in coalition intelligence as “the house of five” other smaller shia militias included but were not limited to saraya almukhtar saraya alqasar 15th sha’aban harakat hezbollah fi aliraq and harakat sayyid alshuhada in iran at an irgcqf camp in kermanshah almuhandis built the initial cadre aided by irgcqf and lebanese hezbollah trainers23 kh set a new standard for operational security prior to us withdrawal in 2011 kh never became larger than around 400 members24 most of the members were badr veterans with property and family in iran but sadrist hardliners joined as well25 entrants were accepted only by the personal recommendation and guarantee of another member a form of vetting through family and tribal networks26 in 20072011 the remaining years of the us presence kata’ib hezbollah attack cells undertook many of the most advanced and effective attacks against coalition forces deadly improvised rocketassisted mortar iram attacks on us bases using disguised launch vehicles27 the hacking of a us predator control signal28 and even an explosivelyformed penetrator efp attack on a uk hercules aircraft on a runway in maysan29 in recognition of this status kh and almuhandis were designated for terrorism by the united states in december 2009 which reinforced the sense that the two were synonymous30 until the last us soldier left kh kept up active “resistance” operations in june 2011 kata’ib hezbollah surged attacks against us forces and killed 15 us personnel in an apparent effort to ensure us departure from iraq31 syria and the islamic state kh evolution in 20122014 the withdrawal of us forces from iraq at the end of 2011 might have left kh without a mission and posed an existential quandary were it not for the movement’s transnational alignment with the socalled “axis of resistance”—iran lebanese hezbollah the bashar alassad regime in syria and related iranbacked militias and militants in addition to training and equipping bahraini and saudi shia militants32 to fight their respective sunniled governments kh also joined other proiranian factions in its nonstate intervention in syria’s civil war in syria almuhandis and kh would have the opportunity to repay the debt of the iraqi fasa’il armed groups to iran and lebanese hezbollahl both of which were severely pressured by the nearcollapse of assad’s authority as aymenn altamimi has chronicled the fighters transferred from iraq initially operated under “an entity known as alquwwa alhaydariya the haydari force composed of imported contingents of iraqi fighters from kata’ib hezbollah asa’ib ahl alhaq and kata’ib sayyid alshuhada’ the haydari force had a direct relationship with iran’s islamic revolutionary guard corps and apparently had a wider scale of operations inside syria beyond the damascus area eg aleppo in contrast with liwa abu alfadl alabbas”33 in syria the bestperforming iraqi units in the haydari force were kata’ib hezbollah harakat hezbollah alnujaba34 and the new abu mustafa alsheibani projectm kata’ib sayyid alshuhada kss while some badr and aah units sent to syria were reputedly less effective in this expeditionary role35 effective service in syria propelled kh nujaba and kss into pole position among the fasa’il36 the need for a larger combat force in syria was one driver for the expansion of kh from 400 in 2011 to around 2500 in syria alone in 2013 albeit with the latter recruiting heavily from syrian shia from threatened localities such as alfu’a and kafariya in idlib province37 according to an aymenn altamimi interview with a syrian kh fighter the kh formation in syria was titled “kata’ib hezbollah – syrian front”n in later years kh fighters would move fluidly between allocation to kh units to syria and detachment to the iranian ruhollah meaning in farsi spirit of god division of the irgc in syria38 o kh would suffer unprecedented numbers of casualties in syria compared to the prior losses inflicted on its covert cells by us forces in iraqp almuhandis’s elevation during the war against the islamic state back in iraq almuhandis had domestic ambitions for kh’s next stage when us leverage began to wane in 2010 almuhandis returned to iraq and ensconced himself in the green zone cultivating a very close relationship with then prime minister nouri almaliki39 as the deterioration of security unfolded in 2012 and 2013 almaliki began to rely on the fasa’il kh aah kss harakat hezbollah alnujaba han kataib alimam ali and kataib jund alimam for auxiliary forces40 almuhandis began to lobby almaliki to raise a new statefunded force called the popular defense brigades saraya aldif‘a alsha‘abi to operate under the prime minister’s command alongside the conventional armed forces41 in this period kh fighters in iraq rose in number to around 750 from 400 in 201142 almuhandis jumped quickly on the opportunity of ayatollah ali alsistani’s june 13 2014 fatwa religious edict for mass mobilization against the islamic state43 to secure state funding for the 160000strong popular mobilization forces pmfq a consummate political actor with strong support from irgcqf commander qassem soleimani almuhandis immediately took control of the pmf as its chief executive and vice chairman somewhat similar to his aforementioned role as the deputy—but actually the daytoday leader—of badr as this author has detailed in ctc sentinel and later in a major coauthored monograph44 within the pmf almuhandis controlled the largest single slice of staff roles operational commands combat units and enablers missiles antitank engineering and intelligence as later sections will note kh was at the center of almuhandis’s network of control and was trusted with the most sensitive roles inside the pmf kata’ib hezbollah’s combat forces enlarged hugely with the formation of pmf brigades 45 46 and 47 a total force of around 7500 fighters plus the aforementioned khsyrian front force of 2500 fighters for a total of 1000045 this huge and sudden expansion made kh a truly wellknown and popular force for the first time though many of its initial burst of new recruits were still unaware of the nature of the movementr at the time in the chaos of the 2014 mobilization when recruits were randomly assigned to pmf units at mobilization hubs like taji and samarra46 as hamdi malik recently uncovered the expansion resulted in the refinement of a tiered membership of kh highlevel commanders were referred to as a maternal uncle alkhaals malik states that almuhandis had a unique title “the senior” alshayeb47 the trusted inner circle of kh operators is a layer of mentors called “teachers” muallim48 reporting to these mentors are “the bodies” ajsam who are vetted fighters with track record and some knowledge of how kh functions49 the vast majority of today’s kh members are “the numbers” arqam who are not trusted with information even the real names of their direct commanders50 this new outer layer of members comprises what might be thought of as “big kh” which is rather different from the tiny highlysecure pre2014 movement almuhandis’s changing relations with kh the war against the islamic state brought other important changes for almuhandis that created distance between him and kh coordinating and managing the vast number of militias through the pmf became a constant drain on almuhandis’s time and attention for the first time he built strong relationships with key army commanders such as lieutenant general abdalamir yarallah then iraqi deputy chief of staff for operations from 20142019t almuhandis invested a lot of time in personally tightening relations with northern iraqi shia turkmenu and shia kurds fayliv plus the yazidiw shabakx and kaka’iy communities who were among the most threatened by the islamic state he also invested significant effort in cultivating new relationships with sunni tribes across northern and western iraq notably major power brokers such as former salah aldin governor ahmed aljabbouri also known as abu mazen mishan aljabbouri khamis khanjar and the karbouli family in anbar51 of note almuhandis built such relationships for irgcqf not for kata’ib hezbollah relationships with sunnis and other minority groups in northern iraq were comanaged by almuhandis and a range of irgcqf officers most notably iranian ambassador to baghdad iraj masjedi52 z and the irgcqf northern iraq controller colonel haj ali iqbalpour53 almuhandis trustees including shia turkmen commanders abu ridha yilmaz alnajjar and mohammed mahdi albayati were likewise drawn closer to almuhandis than to their nominal badr leaders but not for kh’s specific benefit54 these cases underline the way in which almuhandis had transcended his primary alignment with kh by the time the war against the islamic state began to wind down one iraqi official with direct experience of kh told the author muhandis was not part of the kh leadership structure but he oversaw it and continued to do so until his death though he directly supervised kh in iraq muhandis was effectively the leader of all iranianaffiliated militias in iraq his decisions governed all of them not just khiraq55 turning rapidly away from military affairs at the end of 2017 almuhandis was in the thick of iraqi government formation following the june 2018 elections quite literally vetting the candidates for president and prime minister and acting as a midwife to the process of birthing the new cabinet almuhandis was one of two major figures influencing iraq’s weak prime minister adel abd’almahdi on a daytoday basis the other being abu jihad real name mohammed alhashemi the prime minister’s chief of staff56 abd’almahdi was strongly influenced by almuhandis and liked him viewing him an unfairly penalized by the united states for saddamera actions in kuwait57 as the war against the islamic state tailed off almuhandis began to develop a coercive instrument to force a consolidation process on the fractious militias—the central security directorate of the pmf under kh official abu zainab allami real name hussein falah aziz allami58 almuhandis’s vision for the pmf was one of consolidation into smaller stronger unitsaa with some fasa’il detached to free themselves up for international activities in support of the socalled axis of resistance the irgcqf and almuhandis continued to trust kh operatives with key tasks—for instance intelligence support for the october 2019 suppression of protests in iraq59 and the may 2019 drone attacks on saudi arabia which were facilitated by kata’ib hezbollah from within iraq60 likewise kata’ib hezbollah secured the tal ashtah dispersal airfield—just west of jawwalah rashad 35 kilometers southwest of kirkuk city— which the irgc used to launch and recover surveillance drones61 “to designate targets for the september 8 2018 precision rocket strike by iran on the kurdistan democratic party of iran kdpi headquarters in koya in iraqi kurdistan which killed 14 and wounded 42 oppositionists”62 when a us m1 abrams tank was partially deconstructed and pieces sent to iran in november 2017 kata’ib hezbollah protected the iranian technicians undertaking the process at camp sa’ad in baqubah diyala63 kh’s return to resistance after 2017 from the outset of the return of us ‘boots on the ground’ in iraq in 2014 kh ensured it was present to ‘shadow’ and observe such forces at every point of presence except the kurdistan region of iraqab this staring match gave way to an active effort to expel us forces from late 2017 onwards as the physical islamic state caliphate collapsed in iraq and us forces were no longer needed to support major combat operationsac israel conducted strikes on kh in syria in 2018 2019 and 2020 at least one israeli strike targeted kh missile transportation units inside iraq in 201964 thus by the middle of 2019 both the united states and israel were focused on kh as their main adversary in iraq while kh viewed the us embassy in baghdad as the controlling force behind the october 2019 protests and behind what was claimed to be an “electronic army of the us”ad there are strong indicators that kh was gearing up for an escalation with the united states inside iraq from october 2019 onwards including the delivery from iran through the iraniraq border of at least four truck containers of unguided rockets of 107mm 122mm and 240mmcaliber manportable air defense systems manpads and 70 antimateriel rifles65 the united states attributed a heavy november 7 2019 rocket attack on us forces66 and then the december 27 2019 killing of an american to khae it retaliated on december 29 2019 against kh in syria and iraq killing 25 and wounding over 50 kh personnel including four midlevel leaders67 the united states interpreted the december 31 2019 assault on the us embassy in baghdad as almuhandis and khdirected retaliation for the strike which was a contributing factor to the us decision to kill almuhandis and soleimani on january 3 202068 part 2 kh in the aftermath of almuhandis’s death until recently it was difficult to disaggregate the power of almuhandis from the power of kh the death of almuhandis on january 3 2020 alongside his superior soleimani gave the first look at kh operating without the benefit of almuhandis’s considerable political skills kh did not show itself openly among the gaggle of fasa’il commandersaf that ran straight to iran to meet soleimani’s successor irgcqf commander brigadier general esmail qaani and to shelter and recover69 of all the fasa’il kh was immediately the most defiant in its tone and public communications refusing to ‘go to ground’ like most of the other militias kh has consistently pushed two objectives since the us struck its forces on december 29 2019 and particularly since almuhandis’s death—to evict the united states and to prevent a strong prowestern politician from becoming prime minister of iraq expelling us forces kh has been the most public and persistent advocate of the eviction of us military forces from iraq both prior to 2011 and since 2017 even before almuhandis’s death kh undertook a widespread campaign of public and text message threats toward iraqi mps to pressure them to vote in favor of expelling us forces from iraq70 intense intimidation preceded the january 5 2020 vote to remove us forces which had no legal effect because of the lack of a quorum71 ag a kh commander adnan almohammadawi inaccurately referred to as “shaykh adnan alhamidawi” in the us identifying informationah was designated by the united states in connection to this effort72 kh mounted rallies against the us presence and repeatedly chided other groups over their cautious approach toward the eviction of us forces73 in early march 2020 kh warned all iraqis to stay more than 1500 meters away from coalition facilities by march 15 that year or risk attack by kh74 kh has been much coyer about what attacks it actually undertakesai it has not claimed a single attack on the united states and has actively denied at least one75 a march 11 2020 rocket attack on camp taji which killed two american troops and one british soldieraj clearly some of the 57 known rocket attacks on us and coalition forces in the first nine months of 202076 have been undertaken by kh though what proportion is unclear on june 25 2020 the iraqi government raided a site in albu aitha just south of baghdad and arrested 14 kh members one of whom was linked by biometric evidence to an unspecified earlier rocket attack77 the extent of kh involvement in the 66 roadside bombings of us or coalition supply convoys in the first nine months of 2020 or three attacks on diplomatic vehicles in the same timeframe is also not known78 it appears that kh is using a proliferation of new group names to claim the attacks the method is to create fake groups claim attacks using these group identities and thus mask kh’s role in the attacks both to enable kh to remain part of the pmf and avoid political criticism for disturbing the stability of iraq though reflagging with multiple new brands is a technique of causing confusion that has worked well in bahrain79 the recent trend in iraq arguably began in may 2019 when a video emerged claiming the establishment of an antius free revolutionaries front that seemed to comprise hardline “splinters” of asa’ib ahl alhaq saraya alashura saraya talia alkhurasani kata’ib sayyid alshuhada liwa altafuf kata’ib jund alimam badr kata’ib hezbollah kata’ib alimam ali and saraya alsalam80 next came the establishment of usbat althaereen league of the revolutionaries on march 15 2020 and then the islamic resistance army another purported mix of existing militias badr kh aah nujaba kss and kata’ib alimam ali announced on april 26 2020 the 100th day since soleimani and almuhandis died81 since then the numbers of groups has skyrocketed including saraya almuntaqim avenger companies ashab alkahf people of the cave thar muhandis revenge for muhandis saraya thawra alashreen althaniya the second 1920 revolution companies saraya awfiya aldam battalion of the guards of blood rab’a allah god’s fellows and qasim aljabbarin defeaters of the global arrogance the latter referring to the united statesak intimidating the iraqi government kh has been more open in threatening iraqi government figures and processes on march 2 2020 for instance kh official abu ali alaskari warned iraqi politicians against choosing mustafa alkadhimi as iraq’s next premier noting he is one of those accused of helping the american enemy to carry out the crime of assassinating the leaders of victory alhajj suleimani the commander and his companion alhajj almohandis and we only consider his nomination as a declaration of war on the iraqi people which will burn what remains of the security of iraq82 kh had been extraordinarily hostile toward alkadhimi in his capacity as the prowestern head of the iraqi national intelligence service inis 83 in april 2020 around 100 kh fighters some armed with rocketpropelled grenades or rpgs swarmed alkadhimi in the international zone holding him for an hour and seizing members of his security detail84 kh also used online channels to leak the names of alkadhimi’s inis senior staffersal ultimately however kh failed to convince other factions to block alkadhimi in the face of strong support for his nomination from alsistani moqtada alsadr and the international community and he was appointed prime minister on may 6 2020 kh suffered a signal defeat being forced to accept the parliamentary appointment of a man it believed was complicit in the targeting of soleimani and almuhandisam unsurprisingly becoming prime minister did not put alkadhimi offlimits to kh intimidation when kh members were detained by the government on june 25 2020 kh commander abu fadak abd’alaziz almohammadawi led a column of around 150 fighters in nearly 30 pickup trucks with at least one carrying a 23millimeter twin antiaircraft cannon and many others bearing armored machinegun mounts to the prime minister’s residence85 and demanded the suspects be released to their custodyan power games within and between the fasa’il no one in the kh leadership could come close to almuhandis in terms of tightness of connection to the irgc via soleimani sharpness of political instincts and coalitionbuilding capacity other factions sought to exploit this making a dash for iran to shelter from potential us followon strikes and to meet soleimani’s successor irgcqf commander brigadier general esmail qaani86 like the mass mobilization of june 2014 the deaths of the two heavyweights opened an opportunity for individual leaders and fasa’il to strengthen their direct ties to the irgcqf the biggest winners were abu ala alwalai of kataib sayyid alshuhada and akram kaabi of harakat hezbollah alnujaba the two main nonkh ‘haydari’ factions with extensive syrian war service who were the only leaders photographed with qaani87 causes for resentment toward kh were already present prior to almuhandis’s death related to its domination of prime pmf offices88 its preferential allocation of paid billets89 its prominent abduction and illegal detention of large numbers of sunni civilians90 and its tendency for brash stunts that drew negative attention to the pmf such as fighting iraqi police in downtown baghdadao or abducting and ransoming kidnapped qatari hunters91 since almuhandis died such stunts have increased in frequency and profile including blatant and unsuccessful efforts to guide the selection of a prime minister physical intimidation of a sitting prime minister and kh troops publicly trampling on pictures of alkadhimi92 an early setback came in february 2020 after a committee of iranbacked fasa’ilap was formed to elect a new vice chairman and operational commander of the pmf to fill the vacancy left with almuhandis’s death whereas almuhandis had the diplomatic skills and the broad acceptance across factions to hold the executive vice chairmanship of the whole pmf the man they elected abu fadak who would later lead the convoy of pickup trucks to the prime minister’s residence was subsequently opposed on february 20 2020 by four shrine foundation hashd units the socalled atabat who were excluded from the committeeaq less publicly there was division within kh itself over abu fadak’s promotion93 though longidentified as almuhandis’s designated successor at the pmf94 he was opposed by the new kh leader abu hussein95 who will be profiled in the next section and briefly faced an unsuccessful challenge from abu mustafa alsheibani now the elder of the fasa’il leadership since almuhandis’s death96 part 3 the postmuhandis power struggle inside kh having reviewed the organizational and political history of kh and almuhandis’s changing relationship with kh this article will now catalogue the institutional assets of kh versus the portfolios that the irgcqf and other iranleaning fasa’il control this further elucidates the large asset base that can be considered institutionally part of kh the kh shura council kh has from its outset employed a collective leadership system which it terms the shura council majlis alshuraar perhaps reflecting some architecting from imad mughniyeh and other lebanese hezbollah advisors the council has some similarities to the shura council of lebanese hezbollah97 like the jihad subcouncil in lebanese hezbollah the kh council has two military wings—a kh special operations arm akin to the islamic jihad organization or external security organization and a khiraq military office akin to the lebanese hezbollah’s islamic resistance conventional military wing98 like the jihad subcouncil in lebanese hezbollah99 as the kh shura council has always had an external “general supervisor”—usually almuhandis until his death but for stretches an iraqilebanese cleric called ayatollah muhammad alsanad based in beirut100 khsyrian front is under direct irgcqflebanese hezbollah control and is not administered by the kh shura council101 the kh shura council normally has five members all of whom are chosen by the irgcqf commander102 unlike in lebanese hezbollah103 the kh shura council is not composed of clerics but instead veteran fighters104 the council rarely meets in full for operational security reasons and then usually only in iran105 under soleimani and almuhandis the shura council received firm guidance from above106 one close observer noted with almuhandis “supervising the shura council members and their decisions with direct support from qassem soleimani”107 today the general supervisors are unknown but may include an unnamed lebanonbased cleric and the less charismatic and knowledgeable irgcqf commander qaani who does not speak arabic108 the author’s indepth researchat suggests that the current shura council is currently composed of the following kh members ahmad mohsen faraj alhamidawi also known as abu hussein abu zalata abu zeid is the secretary general and the commander of kh special operations one of two military forces in khau abu hussein is 46 years old at the time of writing this means he would have reached military age in the early 1990s his special operations branch undertakes operations against us targets and support to foreign shia militants according to two of the author’s contacts with good insight into kh inner politics abu hussein is developing a reputation for being reckless unpredictable and focused on avenging almuhandis109 ahmad zalata alhamidawi is the main point of contact with both former prime minister nouri almaliki and with russian diplomats110 abd’alaziz almohammadawi also known as abu fadak abu hamid is the commander of khiraq military office one of two military forces in kh and also is the acting vice chairmanchief of staff of the pmf abu fadak’s career is relatively well known he is slightly older than abu hussein and joined badr in the late 1980s he was seconded from badr by hadi alameri to work in the special groups in 20042007 and was one of the first kh members he served in almuhandis’s office in iran and knew both qassem soleimani and imad mughniyeh personally abu fadak was on course to lead kh but is reported by multiple of the author’s contacts to have lost seniority in kh due to his personal involvement in the publicized 2015 affair of the kidnapped qatari huntersav abu fadak and abu hussein are reported by multiple of the author’s contacts to have bad personal relations with each other111 abu fadak’s elevation to pmf chief of staff is a return to the fold albeit in a more public role that is suited to an operative whose identity is well known who will be frequently photographed and thus may be considered ‘blown’ as a covert operator with involvement in more sensitive special operations missions sheikh jassim alsudani also known as abu ahmad is in charge of funding and logistics for kh he is described as a “founder” of kh suggesting involvement from the very outset and was previously in badr112 some online sources describe him as a soldier who was captured in the iraniraq war suggesting he is in his 50s at the time of writing113 he served for a period as a military commander in khiraq114 jaafar alghanimi also known as abu islam is responsible for civil affairs at khiraq and is a former kh secretary general115 some online sources describe him as a soldier who was captured in the iraniraq war and then became a badr member116 suggesting he is in his 50s at the time of writing he is described in other online sources as being from basra and a graduate in electricity engineering117 sheikh jassim family name unconfirmed also known as abu kadhim is the final identified member of the shura council he covers administration including kh offices of veteran affairs martyrs and families and healthcare118 other kh commanders there are a number of senior kh commanders who are not presently on the shura council though some seem to have rotated through the council in the past like the shura council members the below figures would merit the honorific “alkhaal” uncle in the hierarchy discovered by hamdi malik119 sheikh adnan almohammadawi adan yousif jassim abu ammar120 is a former shura council member who now runs khiraq’s economic authority121 he was a member of the kh special operations wing and is 42 years old at the time of writing122 suggesting another fighter who would have come to military age in the 1990s he was captured by the united states in 2009 but released by the government of prime minister nouri almaliki in 2010123 as already noted he was identified by the united states as a key figure in the 20182019 effort by kh to intimidate iraqi mps into voting to evict us forces124 he is reported by one of the author’s contacts to be in charge of the jurf assakr base complex see below125 hussein falah aziz allami also known as abu zainab is the head of the central security division csdaw of the pmf126 he is 51 years old at the time of writing suggesting he came into military age in the late 1980s multiple observers describe him as especially close to kh secretary general abu hussein like abu fadak his involvement with the pmf has “surfaced” him into public and international scrutiny he appears to maintain very tight relations with two fasa’il127 that he cooperated with closely to suppress the october 2019 protests in baghdadax namely saraya talia alkhurasani and kata’ib sayyid alshuhada abu zainab is also reputed to control significant financial reserves and economic projects on behalf of abu hussein’s network within kh including oil smuggling operations128 another kh member who was surfaced through his work with the pmf and its role in suppressing protestors is adhab kaytan albahaliay also known as sattar jabbar alta’aban or abu iman albahaliz who is the director of intelligence at the pmf129 compared to other kh senior leaders he is slightly younger a shia kurdish fayli transplant from badr recruited in iraqi kurdistan in the 1990s130 he served in the badr special operations and intelligence unit from the late 1990s then in a ministry of interior intelligence function and then pmf brigade 27 after 2014 until being named head of pmf intelligence in 2016131 abu iman developed the kh technical intelligence branch and holds a range of sensitive files132 in domestic politics he gathers compromising material on politicians ministry directors and security personnel133 when protests erupted in october 2019 he collated hit lists of civil society activists and journalists in partnership with irgcqf cyberintelligence officials and a 19person baghdadbased cell of lebanese hezbollah media operatives134 his responsibilities include target development against us coalition and iraqi kurdish persons and sites135 hussein moanes jabbar alhijami also known as abu ali alaskari abu musa is an enigmatic member of kh who is one of the initial cadre of fighters and who was held by the united states from 20092010 being released at the same time as abu ala alwalai of kata’ib sayyid alshuhada136 moanes is a former shura council member who lived in iran for an extended period and has an iranian wife137 he is a special operations veteran138 and is described on kh telegram channels as the head of security for kh139 unusually for such a figure he became very vocal in the aftermath of almuhandis’s death and was identified by name by the late hisham alhashemi and even photographed140 since then hussein moanes has tried to muddy the picture by denying he was abu ali alaskari but without success141 kh’s other visible personalities are mostly spokesmen muhammed mohyee is the general spokesman for kh and jaafar alhusseini is the military spokesman for khiraq seyyed dr jassim aljazairi is also used as a spokesman and likely heads the media department of khba other kh members carefully hide their identities for instance kh keeps the identities of its three pmf brigade commanders pmf brigades 45 46 and 47 carefully hidden142 the odd kh commander has surfaced to a minimal extent due to their service as pmf directorate commandersbb which almost guarantees their faces are publicized the involvement of kh in the crackdown against iraqi protestors resulted in the surfacing of a few kh regional security commandersbc very occasionally one is identified in the course of their duties with formal iraqi security forcesbd at least one important religious and legal authority for kh has been identified namely mohammed alsafi a karbalabased cleric who is also the religious guide for kata’ib sayyid alshuhada underlining the shared heritage and worldview of the two movements143 generally however kh hides its leaders very effectively and gives public profile only to officials who no longer play sensitive roles144 part 4 nonmilitary aspects of kh similar to forerunner movements such as lebanese hezbollah145 be and the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq146 kh has developed significant nonmilitary activities instead of being a purely military actor the following sections outline the nonmilitary infrastructure and institutions that survived almuhandis’s death khomeinist civil society activities the civil side of kh administered by jaafar alghanimi abu islam represents an alternative to the dominant iraqi model of political blocs with associated militias such as badr moqtada alsadr’s ahrar bloc and asa’ib ahl alhaq’s sadiqun bloc this is because kh does not have a parliamentary bloc unlike all the other major iranbacked fasa’il instead kh has a full range of institutions that recruit shia intellectuals women and youth using khomeinist ideologybf the most important are listed here but there are many more smaller institutions and media platforms besides these alzainabiyat foundation presents itself as an islamic cultural foundation for women and girls that has been operational since at least 2012 and probably as far back as 2008147 it is a khomeinist institution that encourages women to guide their families toward what it presents as the traditions of iraqi and islamic society and encourages women to have children and play a traditional role within the family it has a mass mobilization function that can organize female participation in protests148 imam hussein scout association khashaf alimam alhussein is a khomeinist feeder organization for the armed wing of kh preparing children and young men for military service with kh the organization appears to have been formed in 2011 and mirrors the practices of other shia paramilitary organizations iran’s basij lebanese hezbollah yemen’s ansar allah by basing major activities around summer youth camps in baghdad basra najaf lebanonbg and iran149 the kh scouts have been associated for many years with a very vocal kh military commander known as abu talib alsaidi150 of interest youth are also encouraged on kh telegram platforms to report the movement of foreign military forces as part of a kh “shadow cell”bh academic elites alnukhbah is a khomeinist university campusbased organization that seeks to groom a new generation of welleducated kh members and khleaning professionals it arranges exchange visits and longer fellowships at universities in lebanon and iran and teaches farsi courses the nukhbah also provides paramilitary and multimedia training151 mosques and husseiniyat authority and kh department of doctrine are khomeinist institutions that debate religious doctrine in conferences publish studies pertaining to islam and commemorate martyrs152 target research center markaz alhadaf and guiding light almisbah are clusters of khomeinist thinktanks and libraries that focus on political theory in particular the velayete faqih doctrine of theological governance that is practiced in iran153 these institutes have a network of libraries galleries and exhibits that eulogize kh and pmf martyrs and commemorate anniversaries such as the annual quds day154 kh also has a veritable media empire155 which has been built with advice and technical support from lebanese hezbollah156 this empire includes a beirutbased satellite tv channel aletejah meaning “the direction” radio aletejah radio alkawthar a newspaper almuraqib aliraqi plus a large network of websites telegram channels other social media platforms and affiliates within the broader “axis of resistance” such as the resistance media network and central combat information platform157 the profusion of media activity by kh and the subsequent demand for material is probably one reason why kh has so many highprofile spokesmen—the aforementioned muhammed mohyee sheikh jaafar alhusseini sheikh jassim aljazairi—and also abu ali alaskari who is not a spokesman but nonetheless has a high media profile kh economic activities though kh has long been the irgcqf’s primary partner force in iraq it does not necessarily follow that kh has pole position in the vast moneymaking schemes of the fasa’il158 almuhandis was sometimes accused of being especially partial to kh and its recruits were prioritized for inclusion in the registered numbers of the pmf versus other factions who had significant numbers of unregistered and thus unpaid volunteers159 overall however there has been a careful division of economic spoils between iraq’s militias initially overseen and balanced by almuhandis and soleimani160 bi the division of spoils is implemented through the wakala system referring to the representatives of each militia in ministries government branches and local governmentbj most of the militia rackets in iraq are linked closely to the control of terrain and infrastructurebk and this is one reason for the enduring geographic spheres of influencebl assigned to militias in “liberated” sunni areas of western and northern iraq and even within baghdad city161 institutions are also key terrain for instance kata’ib alimam ali’s leader usdesignated terrorist shibl alzaydi162 had a special interest in the ministry of communications and its contracts163 and most recently qicard the main epayment vendor for social securitybm is suspectedbn of being tapped by militias in schemes where false beneficiaries were created en massbo in contrast to more conventional patronagebased militiasbp it is much harder to paint a picture of kh economic activities numerous kh leaders seem to play an economic role suggesting significant resources but also multiple power bases with their own funding streams164 as noted adnan almohammadawi manages kh’s “economic authority” with main activities in baghdad and basra165 at the same time kh secretary general abu hussein and his close associate abu zainab allami seem to have a separate economic office as well possibly relating to stipends transferred from the irgcqf166 sheikh jassim alsudani abu ahmad acts as a treasurer for kh and disperses funds to kh members and institutions167 less solidly three other figures in kh are reported to play a finance role ahmed aleithawi abu hassanein sheikh adnan almaliki and khalen ismail abu mustapha who are responsible for fundraising within the membership168 a rare known case of kh involvement in a commercial matter is the longrunning saga of ground services at baghdad international airport169 in 20182019 kh forced its way into the running of ground handling services fee collection the vip lounge and an airport hotel170 in addition to using the contracts to gain control over sensitive sites—such as the air traffic control tower and ironically “kilometer one” the private vip road on which soleimani and almuhandis were killed—the kh negotiators sought a 20 percent share of revenues171 kh tried to hide its involvement throughout switching from one commercial partner to another employing a cabinetlevel official to unknowingly lobby on kh’s behalf and mounting an intimidation bombing attack on a rival bidder in one of najaf’s most exclusive and wellprotected elite neighborhoods172 underlining kh’s vulnerability to exposure kh was forced by the government in late september 2020 to close its known offices in the airport and its partners were removed from various functions at the airport being replaced by sadristlinked companies173 bq another case that sheds interesting light on kh’s politicaleconomic modus operandi is that of falah aljazairy onetime mayor of baghdad’s city council a major potential source of civil contracts according to multiple wellplaced contacts with direct experience of iraqi investigations when aljazairy faced oustingbr due to opposition within the council kh warned his opponents “falah belongs to us leave him alone if you touch falah you are touching us”174 what this case suggests and which a range of interviewees flagged with the author is that kh operates a hidden influence network based on covert sponsorship partnership blackmail and intimidation175—an important hidden layer of the movement that does not correspond to the levels of membership identified by hamdi malik such as alkhaal muallim ajsam and arqam part 5 kh military infrastructure and roles as the above section suggests kh has historically appeared less focused on venal moneymaking schemes than is typical for fasa’il with kh more focused on strategic portfolios and terrain this strategic focus may be apparent in kh’s geographic focus which is mostly limited to a triangular zone between the kh base at jurf assakr in southern baghdad and the iraqsyrian border crossing points of akashat bypassing the usbacked garrison at altanf176 and alqaim adjacent to albu kamal in syria this socalled “land bridge”177 between iran and assadcontrolled syria is not the commercially richest real estate in iraq—far from it—but it is of vital interest to iran the “axis of resistance” the united states and israel the jurf assakr redoubt the jurf assakr site 40 kilometers southwest of baghdad is the principal military hub for kh and has been discussed in detail in a prior ctc sentinel study by the author178 built on villages from which the sunni population was expelled and not readmitted179 jurf has become an exclusive kh principality in which government forces cannot enter and where kh formally acquired land use rights from the government180 it is the site of kh’s extensive private prisons holding well over 1000 illegal detainees181 plus medical rehabilitation housing for fighters both pmf brigades 46 and 47 are headquartered in jurf182 jurf is the hub of munitions manufacturing storage and testing facilities that kh operates in the rural southern arc of baghdad in some cases reusing saddamera military industrial sitesbs kh worked hard to ban us drone overflights of jurf assakr from march 2019 onwards183 months before the site was used to launch two explosive drones toward saudi arabian oil pipeline pumping stations on may 14 2019184 the march 13 2020 us airstrikes on the jurf area struck materials described by the united states as the “jurf assakr propellant production and advanced conventional weapons storage site” the “alyowm alazran rocket motor test facility” the “musayyib terrorist weapons storage site” the “arab hawar terrorist rocket storage site” and the “jurf improvised rocketassisted mortar iram storage site”185 also on march 13 2020 the united states struck a site further west that it termed the “karbala kata’ib hezbollah advanced conventional weapons storage site” which was collocated with the uncompleted karbala airport and where nonkh pmf troops from an atabat brigade were reportedly struck and three civilians wounded186 kh also claims to operate a “medium range rocket facility” at ain altamur 70 kilometers west of karbala southwest of lake rezazah and a munitions factory at zaafaraniyah just outside urban baghdad 10 kilometers to the southeast187 the iraqi government arrested one suspected kh rocketeer and 13 other kh members on june 25 2020 at a rocket storage site in albu aitha 20 kilometers south of baghdad188 western anbar and albu kamal bases for kh kh has worked hard to develop its presence in anbar an area to which it is entirely alien as there is virtually no shia population there kh has been deploying to western anbar since 2013 and has used the area to reach syrian battlefields189 though anbar is theoretically under the command of both a threestar military headquarters anbar operations command and the pmf west anbar operations command or axis there is also an underlying khdominated zone which the group calls the kh jazeera operations command that spans the jurfakashatqaim area190 in this area kh has invested great effort in removing adversaries for instance ousting the anbar operations command leader and both customs posts at the akashat and qaim end and building up covert influence networks191 kh has developed a large informant and influence network in anbar that spans the anbar operations command anbar police national security service provincial and district officials and the 8th and 14th iraq army divisions192 the western anbar bases of kh and closely allied militias were detailed in an august 2019 study for ctc sentinel by this author193 it consists of two subsectors the eastern alqaim border crossing on the euphrates facing the albu kamal areas in syria194 and the western akashat subsector headquartered in rutbah195 the main kh headquarters in alqaim is the base for pmf brigade 45 the praetorian kh fighting force and was struck by us forces on december 29 2019 killing the pmf brigade 45 commander kadhim alwan abu ali aldibi196 kh forces mainly from pmf brigade 46 control highway 20 which parallels the iraqsyria border be­tween the two subsectors197 and ranches between the highway and the border198 bt these rural areas close to the iraqsyria oil pipeline corridor and its coaxial road are used to move missile or rocket forces to syria199 of note an earlier august 25 2019 airstrike apparently israeli struck moving vehicles that were positioned about halfway between two of the sites hit later by the united states on december 29 2019 underlining israel’s intense focus on the chain of bases200 immediately over the border a few kilometers west of the husaybah customs point and linked by dedicated tracks is kh’s imam ali base just outside the syrian town of albu kamalbu after the aleppo campaign at the end of 2016 khsyrian front concentrated its military efforts in syria on the deir ezzor area and the town of albu kamal which was captured from the islamic state in september 2017201 on june 18 2018 israel struck kh in albu kamal for the first time hitting the original kh headquarters close to the border202 and then struck the imam ali base on september 8 2019203 january 5 2020204 and march 11 2020205 the latter strike hit 15 structures in the broader albu kamal area including warehouses at the imam ali base another kh site in the industrial quarter two fatimiyoun sites and hezbollah harakat alnujaba base in albu kamal town and two kata’ib sayyid alshuhada base just southeast of albu kamal town206 according to press reporting based on satellite imagery the imam ali base may have significant underground facilities including perhaps a tunnel to the iraqi side of the border207 in mayadin 50 miles north of albu kamal kh is reported to have other warehouses at a site called alhaydaria208 there may also be a southern anbar aspect to kh operations though nominally within the atabat zone of responsibility the anbarkarbalanajaf border209 the town of nukhayb dominating the trade highway to saudi arabia and an important bypass around baghdad toward syria has had a kh presence since 2011bv nukhayb was reportedly given over to kh as its exclusive operational zone in 2016 whereupon it took over all six major military sites in the town210 in addition to strong rumors about possible use of nukhayb as a training site for iranbacked shia saudi terrorists211 it may have been a launch pad for drone attacks on saudi oil facilities212 bw despite its major investment in anbar kh has arguably failed to dominate the environment as completely as it might have hoped both the us sites at alasad and tanf remain iraq counterterrorism service and customs personnel are returning to alqaim213 local iraqi forces have been restaffed with capable commandersbx and local communities in populated parts of anbar are beginning to protest the extent of militia presence and control of territoryby most significantly israeli and us attacks have shown that anbar is very exposed to aerial attacks resulting in iran and its militias pulling back some key assets to southern iraq in 20192020214 part 6 power projection and missiles during almuhandis’s tenure at the head of the iraqi fasa’il irgcqf began to project power against its enemies from iraq in addition to attacking us and other western targets in iraq and reinforcing other axis of resistance forces in syria iraq was used as launch pad for attacks into the sunniled gulf states terrorist training facilities and longrange strike systems became operational on iraqi territory kh has been associated with key attacks such as the may 14 2019 drone attacks on saudi arabia215 z and support to militant groups in bahrain216 but there are signs that other iraqi fasa’il such as saraya aljihad see below are also now working on these portfolios iranian missiles and drones the main hub for iranian missiles inside iraq is now the maysandhi qarwasit triangle not western anbar the missile caching system is built around a longstanding relationship217 between saraya aljihad pmf brigade 17 leader hassan alsari real name hassan radi kazim kat’e alsari218 and irgcqf brigadier general ahmad forouzandeh219 who has commanded the southern iraq axis of irgcqf operations in iraq since 2002220 while not a member of kh hassan alsari has functioned since the early 2000s as the key southern iraq logistician for the special groups and then kh playing an important role in the special groups and sheibani network221 the daytoday custodian of the irgcqf missile force in iraq is hamad mohsen mujabir abu iman aldarraji who also has a nominal role as the pmf director of intelligence in basra222 missiles and larger rockets are now moved from iran into iraq in parts where possible broken down into warhead fuel and body which allows smaller and less conspicuous vehicles like water or oil tankers and smaller shipping containers to be used223 advanced types inside iraq are believed to include kheiber1 302mm 65 miles badr1 and badr1p 210mm rocket 90mile range and possibly raad500 1100lb high explosive 350 miles224 ca warheads and rocket bodies are often kept separated in sites in kumayt near amarah batha near nasiriyah and numaniyah near kut with each site having a network of satellitedispersal points and workshops to assemble missiles or rockets225 a cadre of technically proficient weapons assemblers are retained full time in abu iman aldarraji’s network and their skills and loyalty are retained by being given a house a fulltime salary and frequent changes of phonecb the cases of alsari and aldarraji underline how personal relationships often trump ephemeral organizational labels iran is quite capable of combining two adjacent networks—alsarialdarraji and kh—to handle its missile forces in iraq support to foreign terrorists a second mechanism for power projection from iraq is the training and arming of terrorists and militants outside the country as matt levitt wrote in ctc sentinel in february 2020 a shift to “noniranian and nonlebanese shi’a militants” is a likely evolution of tradecraft in iranbacked foreign operations226 once again kh shares this portfolio with a pantheon of trusted irgcqf partners kh has reportedly been involved in the media training military training and arming of bahraini militants and likely saudis also as the author and matt levitt detailed in ctc sentinel in january 2018cc abu iman aldarraji also appears to be a major player in hosting and training foreign volunteers from the gulf states and yemencd operating what the author believes is the largest iranbacked foreign fighter training site located in kumayt maysance hassan alsari and abu iman aldarraji also appear to play a role in the routing of irgcqf materiel from iran to umm qasrcf in basra iraq and thereafter to oman for onward carriage to yemencg the author was told that irgcqf operations focused on jordan uses usdesignated terrorist shibl alzaydi’s car import and export operations as a cover to reconnoiter israeli tourist targets in jordan and to scout border crossing points for explosive shipments via wadi assad a valley linking jordan and iraq227 abu mustafa alsheibani also continues to play a role in external operations from an iraqi base working with the ministry of intelligence and security mois or ettela’at as opposed to the irgcqf and focused on developing intelligence and logistical penetration of the gulf states228 part 7 the kh role in domestic politics under soleimani and almuhandis kh became the vanguard of a militia network that came very close to complete domination of iraq’s government in the late summer of 2019229 since then popular protests the killing of soleimani and almuhandis and the appointment of prime minister mustafa alkadhimi have begun to roll back these militia gains230 as kh showed in the early months of 2020 it is not afraid to influence national politics and dictate its preferences on issues as consequential as the selection of iraq’s prime minister and it did not hesitate to physically threaten the iraqi premier thus far its political intimidation has achieved little but with iraqi elections due in 2021 or 2022—and with mounting domestic and international pressure to rein in militiasch—kh and its partners may still choose to fight reforms headon what role might kh be expected to play in domestic political violence kh’s threat to the iraqi government as seen in its show of force immediately outside the iraqi prime minister’s residence on june 25 2020 kh can quickly muster and deploy “flying columns” of fighters mounted in “technical” pickup trucks often with heavy machine guns and even 23mm cannons and drive them to the heart of the international zone iz when the iraqi government arrested 14 kh members nominally serving within the pmf earlier that day abu fadak’s response had been tribal for the show of force he had gathered other unit members from the detainee’s base at albu aitha to get their people backci kh can draw fighters from its headquarters inside the iz though it is noteworthy that abu fadak brought most of his column on june 25 2020 from outside the zone suggesting that perhaps the raw numbers of fighters inside the iz are lower than apocryphally reportedcj in greater baghdad kh can draw on supporters in its many sites in the palestine street area east of the tigris river near tahrir square including the main kh mosque the baqiyatalah mosque231 note that palestine street was where kh fighters fled for protection with five stolen cars after they engaged in a shootout with police in 2018232 farther out kh could draw on reinforcements and heavy weapons from around two dozen outposts and checkpoints on the baghdad outskirts and from the jurf assakr base complex which is an hour’s drive away yet in any confrontation with the iraqi government the most potent weapon kh enjoys is still the “fear factor” it projects onto iraqi military commanders standing in its way—that if kh does not get you today it will assuredly kill you one day if you oppose it233 this reputation is the center of gravity of kh’s power and influence and must be reversed the kh role in suppressing protests though kh did play an important role in coordinating and targeting the crackdown on protests in october 2019 the group left the sniping and beating of civilians largely to badrck and other fasa’ilcl kh operatives such as abu iman albahali focused on targeting protest leaders and leveraging unique relationships with iranian and lebanese hezbollah technical intelligence and cyber units234 in the future kh is likely to stay focused on the higherend aspects of repression such as identifying ringleaders and compromising their electronic communications to give one example in october 2019 kh covertly assisted with the donation of protest placards that contained rfid tags passive tracking devices similar to antitheft tags in merchandise or library books to track protestors235 in another example of the important role of trusted but less visible irgcqf partners additional attention should be focused on kadhim aljabiri the commander of saraya alashura pmf brigade 8 and also nominally the director of training for the pmf236 operating between three houses in baghdad and a former saddam family ranch in doura south baghdadcm aljabiri has taken the leading role in identifying civil society and political figures for assassination or incarceration in baghdadcn in basra abu mustafa alsheibani plays the same role in targeting activists237 and in other southern iraq areas the targeting of activists is led by jassim almaliki an aide to abu iman aldarraji238 aljabiri operates a secret prison on the south side of the karrada peninsula in baghdad that belongs to hassan alsari and saraya aljihad239 new deniable networks whereas fasa’il like saraya talia alkhurasani and kata’ib sayyid alshuhada openly murdered iraqis in the streets a year ago240 today the killers of protest leaders are increasingly faceless this is because the impunity enjoyed by militias is no longer assured and therefore deniability is important once again kadhim aljabiri’s network perhaps foreshadows the next evolution of iraqi militias in the irgcqf stable aljabiri’s key subordinate sarhan toman alshibli appears to be focusing on recruiting young individuals with no track record and no prior prison terms ie no biometrics in us or iraqi databases241 these operators undertake a targeted killing for a cash bounty and lay low in a different city or abroad for a few months with a monthly payment of around 1500242 according to the author’s interviews a similar type of arrangement seems to be used in basra for instance by alsheibani’s contract killers thar allah god’s revenge243 co and in southern iraq by abu iman aldarraji’s group244 there are also signs that kh is developing “armslength” relations with a pantheon of street vigilante groups that hamdi mailk described as “proiran thuggish youth groups”245 malik lists these as “rab’a allah god’s fellows jabhat abu jeddahah people of lighters front alzelm alkhashnah tough guys fariq fatemiyoun almaydani fatemiyoun field group jond soleimani soleimani’s soldiers shabeebat alsafwa youth of purity”246 these groups attack tv stationscp and even political party officescq that criticize kh and other militias as hamdi malik has noted kh social organizations like selfidentified members of the zaynabiyat woman’s foundation take part in such arson attacks247 suggesting other kh youth and student groups could also be used to mobilize vigilantism a very similar model of forming multiple deniable front organizations seems to be emerging for attacks on us and other western targets in the author’s view backed by the views of his own network of close observerscr kh remains the mobilizing force behind rocket attacks on coalition sites and attacks on coalitionlinked trucking but it cannot claim attacks and must distance itself from them due to the growing domestic stigma around such actions which kill more iraqis than foreigners and which are complicating iraq’s efforts to recover from the covid19 pandemic and the oil price crash and normalize its relations with the international community it appears that qassem soleimani foresaw this need months before his death as the major protests began in october 2019 and escalation with the united states loomed he recommended a shift to deniable attacks248 based on investigative reporting with iraqi sources reuters reported the following meeting taking place in october 2019 at the baghdad villa in october 2019 soleimani told the assembled commanders to form a new militia group of lowprofile paramilitaries – unknown to the united states – who could carry out rocket attacks on americans housed at iraqi military bases he ordered kata’ib hezbollah – a force founded by muhandis and trained in iran – to direct the new plan said the militia sources briefed on the meetings soleimani told them such a group “would be difficult to detect by the americans” one of the militia sources told reuters249 this may go some way to explaining the aforementioned profusion of new groups claiming attacks on foreign targets this effort is led today by one of soleimani’s close aides known as hajj hamidcs who instituted a new intake of iraqi recruits under the name of alwarithuun the inheritors for training at an irgcqf camp in dezful in northwestern iran250 following the post2011 wars in syria and iraq there are now a significant crop of experienced young fighters to choose from if as some reports suggest groups like aljabiri’s have recently been reinforced with shipments of silencers antimateriel rifles and even manpads251 the outline of a more covert terroristtype threat may be coming into view in iraq part 8 conclusion kata’ib hezbollah and the fasa’il in a postmuhandis world ever since abu mahdi almuhandis and kata’ib hezbollah were designated on the same day in 2009 by the us government they have been viewed synonymously by many analysts including this authorct yet while almuhandis did help create kh and did oversee its activities the two became increasingly distinct after the withdrawal of us forces from iraq in 2011 almuhandis exercised his political role as the coordinator of all the iraqi shia militias and eventually all the pmf components this means that his death struck not just kh but them all loosening their ties removing an important conflict resolution mechanism and leaving them harder to control abu fadak is a completely different type of player less capable not broadly accepted more narrowly associated with kh and not even dominant within kh and backed by a less powerful irgcqf leader as one us intelligence official noted to the author “muhandis knew how to herd the cats of kh they knew better than to argue with him kh is not a cat to be herded since he died”252 an iraqi government official with excellent access to fasa’il actors went further kata’ib hezbollah are wild they are doing their own thing like cowboys they are reckless and always looking for new things to do in iraq and syria uncoordinated things and this is pissing off the others political factions who think they have a political future but who are afraid to lose their hardline voter base253 the loss of kh’s overseer—almuhandis the soldierstatesman—is evident in the setbacks that are now mounting up the collapse of the adel abd’almahdi premiership the failure to replace him with another proiran politician the ascension of alkadhimi as premier and now a firm pattern of appointments and government steps to rein in militias254 though kh remains the premier counterus force in iraq probably linked to a high proportion of recent antius rocket and roadside bomb attacks it has lost its political edge the dominant militant wing within kh—abu hussein and abu zainab allami—has little ongoing connection to the political process now that almuhandis is dead they are highly committed muqawamistscu ie committed to the transnational antiusisraelsaudi “resistance” camp and specifically to evicting us forces from the middle east and avenging soleimani almuhandis and kh casualties there are early signs that kh is becoming isolated and unresponsive to signals from partners including irancv one option for the irgcqf mois and lebanese hezbollah is to “go it alone” in some of their activities in the weak state environment of iraq in retreading the history of almuhandis kh and other iranbacked fasa’il it becomes clear that iranian and lebanese leaders did not just work indirectly channeling their influence through almuhandis or another central point from the outset they have also worked directly with an array of iraqi militia leaders and they are increasingly doing so powerful lebanese hezbollah operatives such as the kawtharani brothers see footnote l are today capable of directly influencing many militias in iraq even sadrist elementscw and lebanese hezbollah increasingly uses iraq as a cash cow255 building on almuhandis’s efforts described in ctc sentinel in august 2019256 the irgcqf can directly influence northern iraqi militias from a range of minorities—shia kurds fayli and shia turkmen yazidi shabak and most notably sunni arabs and turkmen irgcqf front companies have learned how to navigate iraq’s ports as if they were extensions of iran partnering with individual iraqis as opposed to major factions or militias257 iran and lebanese hezbollah do not necessarily have to work through iraqi factions to use iraq as a power projection hub and can use iraqis of any sect or ethnicity as agents or terrorists irgcqf clearly has more irons in the fire than just kh and it could choose to blend some familiar and some novel elements to create a new kind of resistance front in iraq this study has drawn attention to two nonkh leaders who may emerge as more important players in the future abu iman aldarraji of saraya aljihad and kadhim aljabiri of saraya alashura both are entrusted by the irgcqf with key duties that span counterprotest counterus and regional force projection portfolios like almuhandis and alsheibani they are both products of the continual splintering of the root organization badr which is rapidly disintegrating into more and more factionscx likewise if kh advanced conventional weapon sites become too closely observed the irgcqf might be able to “plugin” to facilities maintained by other fasa’il such as kata’ib sayyid alshuhada’s section of camp saqr in southern baghdad258 or kata’ib alimam ali’s large compound of buried ammunition storage “igloos” in suwayrah airport259 as one wellinformed iraqi noted iran doesn’t have a favorite group at the moment and the supreme leader is displeased with all iraqi militias and only trusts and will depend on lebanese hezbollah iran continues to support the various militias and has not cut any of them off however they are selecting talented and willing individuals and organizing small groups and supporting these who go by various names they don’t have much hope for the current militias260 having emerged out of anonymity around 15 years ago kh and other toptier irgcqf proxies in iraq may once again be ordered to atomize reconfigure and sink back into the shadows it should not be surprising if today’s greatly enlarged kh itself begins to fall victim to factionalism and defections especially due to the absence of either soleimani or almuhandis as a peacemaker the aforementioned formation of alwarithuun the inheritors could be a signpost of a shavingoff of younger talented and anonymous operators that is highly reminiscent of the formation of kh itself     ctc
