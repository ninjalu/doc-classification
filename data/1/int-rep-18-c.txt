Police say a mental health patient visiting the hospital for a routine check-up apparently
brought a bag with a plastic hand grenade connected to batteries. While the doctor was examining the

The government must deploy more security personnel as we draw near the harmonised
elections in a couple of weeks to come. We seem to be heading for a political turbulence in the country as
we notice some kind of political disturbances and there is need to quickly attend to this problem as soon

challenges.
