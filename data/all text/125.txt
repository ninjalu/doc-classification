 Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis (ABM)âalso known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)-Sinai Provinceâis the most active and capable terrorist group operating in Egypt. ABMâwhich pledged allegiance to ISIL in November 2014, becoming ISIL’s Sinai Provinceâseeks   the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic emirate   and implementation of sharia in the Sinai Peninsula. The group is based   in the Sinai but in fall 2013 expanded its operational reach into Egypt’s Nile Valley. ABM emerged in 2011 when it claimed responsibility for a cross-border attack into southern Israel from the Sinai. Since 2011, ABM has carried out additional cross-border   attacks, launched rocket attacks against Israel, and repeatedly bombed   the gas pipeline in the Sinai that supplies natural gas to Israel and Jordan. Following the August 2013 crackdown by Egyptian security forces on   those protesting the ouster of President Muhammad Mursi, ABM launched a   campaign of attacks against Egyptian government and security targets.   ABM since then has claimed responsibility for several of the highest-profile   and sophisticated attacks in Egypt, including an attempted   assassination of the Egyptian Minister of the Interior, the downing of   an Egyptian military helicopter in the Sinai with a surface-to-air missile, and several deadly vehicle-borne   improvised explosive device attacks against Egyptian security   installations. ABM for the first time demonstrated its willingness to   target civilians when it claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing on   a tourist bus in the Sinai in February 2014, though ABM described the   attack as targeting Egyptian economic interests. The group also claimed   responsibility for an August 2014 carjacking in Egypt’s   western desert that killed a US oil worker. Since announcing its formal   alignment with ISIL in late 2014, ABM has conducted several of its most   lethal and sophisticated attacks to date and has continued to focus   attacks primarily against Egyptian government and security targets.   However, the group claimed responsibility for a June 2015 rocket and   mortar attack against the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) base   in the Sinai, the first terrorist attack against MFO facilities. ABM has not made explicit threats against the West or Western   targets in its official propaganda. However, the group views the West,   and the United States in particular, as supporters of Israel and Egypt   and expresses anti-Western sentiment in its rhetoric.   Various social media accounts claiming association with the group have   posted threats to US and other Western targets, although ABM has   repeatedly denied a social media presence. The US State Department designated ABM as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in April 2014. The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control has designated several ABM-affiliated persons and groups as Specially Designated Nationals.

In this system, the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âe.â For example, the name of the al-Qaâida operative who was detained on 1 March 2003 is Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; he was an associate of Usama Bin Ladin, not Osama Bin Laden. We have retained, however, the spellings used on the Rewards for Justice and FBI terrorism sites; spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules. The Islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon. The Islamic year contains 12 months, none of which can exceed 30 days. Each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon. Because 12 lunar months multiplied by 29.53 days equals 354.36 days, the Islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the Western (Gregorian) calendar. For example, 1 Muharram, the first day of Islamic year 1437 (known in the West by the Latin term Anno Hegirae, or A.H.), fell on 14 October 2015; in A.H. 1438, 1 Muharram falls on 2 October 2016. Because of lunar observation and differences in time zones, the observance of Islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region. Islamic dates and holidays are approximate, as they are determined by local lunar observation. Islamic and Jewish holidays begin the evening preceding the date shown unless stated otherwise.
