 The largest unexploded World War Two bomb ever found in Poland has detonated during an attempt to defuse it. The RAF dropped the Tallboy or "earthquake" bomb in a raid in 1945 which sank the German cruiser LÃ¼tzow. The Polish Navy said there had been a 50:50 chance the bomb would explode and all the divers were unharmed. The bomb was at the bottom of a Baltic Sea shipping canal, and about 750 residents near the port city of Swinoujscie were evacuated. WW2 bomb explodes during attempt to defuse it.
