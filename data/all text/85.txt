 The largest unexploded World War Two bomb ever found in Poland has detonated during the defusing process, a Polish Navy spokesman said. The chance the bomb - at the bottom of a Baltic Sea shipping canal - would detonate had been put at 50-50 and all the divers were unharmed. About 750 residents had been evacuated near the port city of Swinoujscie. The RAF dropped the Tallboy or "earthquake" bomb in a raid in 1945 which sank the German cruiser LÃ¼tzow. Swinoujscie was part of Germany and called SwinemÃ¼nde at the time of the bombardment.  The shock of the latest detonation was reportedly felt in parts of the city and a video shows the blast throwing up a large column of water into the air. The bomb was 6m (19ft) long and weighed 5.4 tonnes, nearly half of which was its explosives. The bomb was embedded at a depth of 12m and only its nose was sticking out. Naval forces used a remote-controlled device to try to "deflagrate" the bomb - a technique that if successful burns the explosive charge without causing a detonation, the BBC's Adam Easton reports from Warsaw. "The deflagration process turned into detonation. The object can be considered neutralised, it will not pose any more threat to the Szczecin-Swinoujscie shipping channel," said Lt Cmdr Grzegorz Lewandowski, spokesman for the Polish Navy's 8th Coastal Defence Flotilla. "All divers were outside the danger zone."
