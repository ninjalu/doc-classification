Al-Shabaab spokesman, Ahmed Abdi aw Mohamed, announced Abu Ubaidah as the group’s leader on September 6, 2014, after the death of former al-Shabaab emir Ahmed Abdi aw-Mohamed (Godane).  Abu Ubaidah was part of Godane’s inner circle at the time of Godane’s death.  The United Nations (UN) subjected him to sanctions pursuant to paragraph 8 of UN Security Council Resolution 1844 on September 24, 2014.  He is believed to subscribe to Godane’s view that al-Shabaab is more than a Somali nationalist movement and instead is one front in al-Qaida’s global jihad.

He is believed to be in his forties and is a member of the Dir clan from the Kismayo region of Somalia.
