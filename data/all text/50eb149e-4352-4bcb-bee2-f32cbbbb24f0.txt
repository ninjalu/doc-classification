Turkey’s Competition Authority has issued an administrative fine of 196.7m Turkish liras (25m US dollars) to technology giant Google on the grounds of violating the protection of competition law, state-funded Anadolu Agency reported on 13 November.
It said the company’s "intensive" use of text ads on top of its search results complicated the activities of organic search results which do not bring advertisement revenue in the content services market and violated the law on the protection of competition.
The authority had previously launched an investigation into the company in 2019 over “the misuse of its dominant situation in the general search market”.
In February, it issued a 98.3m liras (12m dollars) administrative fine to Google, saying that the company had complicated the activities of its competitors in the online shopping services market by “misusing its dominant situation in the general search market”.
In 2018, it issued another administrative fine of 93m liras to the company for iolating competition law related to the offering of Android, its mobile operating system, as well as mobile applications and services.
