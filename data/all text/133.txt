 Formed in 1982 in response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Hizballah (the “Party of God”), a Lebanon-based Shia terrorist group, advocates Shia empowerment globally. Hizballah has been involved in numerous anti-US   terrorist attacks, including the suicide truck bombings of the US   Embassy in Beirut in April 1983, the US Marine barracks in Beirut in   October 1983, and the US Embassy annex in Beirut in September 1984, as   well as the hijacking of TWA 847 in 1985 and the Khobar Towers attack in   Saudi Arabia in 1996.  Hizballah has participated in the Lebanese Government since 1992.   With the 2004 passage of UN Security Council Resolution 1559, which   called for the disarmament of all armed militias in Lebanon, Hizballah   has focused on justifying its retention of arms by casting itself as the   defender of Lebanon against Israeli aggression. On 12 July 2006,   Hizballah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers, sparking the 2006 war in which   Hizballah claimed victory by virtue of its survival. It has since   sought to use the conflict to justify its need to retain its arms as a   Lebanese resistance force. In May 2008, Hizballah militants seized parts   of Beirut in response to calls by the government to restrict Hizballah’s   secure communications and arms. In negotiations to end the violence,   Hizballah gained veto power in the government and retained its arms and   secure communications.  In July 2011 the UN Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) indicted four Hizballah membersâincluding a senior Hizballah officialâfor the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, who was killed by a car-bomb   in Beirut on 14 February 2005. Hizballah leader Hasan Nasrallah has   publicly stated that Hizballah will not allow any members to be   arrested, and continues to paint the STL as a proxy of Israel and the   United States.  In February 2008, Hizballah military chief ‘Imad Mughniyah was   killed by a vehicle bomb in Damascus. Nasrallah publicly blamed Israel   and continues to promise retaliation. Additionally, Hasan al-Laqis,   a senior Hizballah military leader, was shot and killed outside his   home on 3 December 2013. Hizballah accused Israel of responsibility for   the killing, although Tel Aviv denied involvement. Two unknown extremist   factions issued statements claiming responsibility for the killing. Since Mughniyah’s death, the group has engaged in its   most aggressive terrorist campaign targeting Israeli interests outside   the Middle East since the 1990s. In July 2012, Hizballah detonated a   bomb on a bus in Burgas, Bulgaria, killing five Israeli tourists and a   Bulgarian. Several other plots have been disrupted, including the 2014   arrests of operatives in Peru and Thailand and the 2015 discovery of an   explosives cache and identification of an operative in Cyprus.  Nasrallah publicly indicated in May 2013 that Hizballah was supporting Bashar al-Asad’s   regime by sending fighters to Syria, including Iraqi Shia militias. The   group also supports Palestinian rejectionist groups in their struggle   against Israel and provides training for Iraqi Shia militants attacking   Western interests in Iraq. The European Union designated Hizballah’s   military wing as a terrorist organization on 22 July 2013, following   the March conviction that year of a Hizballah member in Cyprus, the July   2012 bus bombing in Bulgaria, and the group’s intervention in Syria.

In this system, the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âe.â For example, the name of the al-Qaâida operative who was detained on 1 March 2003 is Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; he was an associate of Usama Bin Ladin, not Osama Bin Laden. We have retained, however, the spellings used on the Rewards for Justice and FBI terrorism sites; spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules. The Islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon. The Islamic year contains 12 months, none of which can exceed 30 days. Each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon. Because 12 lunar months multiplied by 29.53 days equals 354.36 days, the Islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the Western (Gregorian) calendar. For example, 1 Muharram, the first day of Islamic year 1437 (known in the West by the Latin term Anno Hegirae, or A.H.), fell on 14 October 2015; in A.H. 1438, 1 Muharram falls on 2 October 2016. Because of lunar observation and differences in time zones, the observance of Islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region. Islamic dates and holidays are approximate, as they are determined by local lunar observation. Islamic and Jewish holidays begin the evening preceding the date shown unless stated otherwise.
