 Usama BinÂ Ladin formed al-Qa‘ida in 1988 with Arabs who fought in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union, and declared its goal as the establishment of a pan-Islamic caliphate throughout the Muslim world. Toward this end, al-Qa‘ida seeks to unite Muslims to fight the West, especially the United States, as a means of overthrowing Muslim regimes al-Qa‘ida deems “apostate,” expelling Western influence from Muslim countries, and defeating Israel. Al-Qa‘ida   issued a statement in February 1998 under the banner of “the World   Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders” saying it was   the duty of all Muslims to kill US citizensâcivilian and militaryâand their allies everywhere. The group merged with the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (al-Jihad) in June 2001. On 11 September 2001, 19 al-Qa‘ida suicide attackers hijacked and crashed four US commercial jetsâtwo   into the World Trade Center in New York City, one into the Pentagon   near Washington, D.C., and a fourth into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvaniaâleaving nearly 3,000 people dead. Al-Qa‘ida   also directed the 12 October 2000 attack on the USS Cole in the port of   Aden, Yemen, which killed 17 US sailors and injured another 39, and   conducted the bombings in August 1998 of the US embassies in Nairobi,   Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 224 people and injuring more   than 5,000. Since 2002, al-Qa‘ida and affiliated groups have conducted attacks worldwide, including in Europe, North Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. In 2005, Ayman al-Zawahiri, then Bin Ladin’s deputy, publicly claimed al-Qa‘ida’s involvement in the 7 July 2005 bus bombings in the United Kingdom. In 2006, British security services foiled an al-Qa‘ida plot to detonate explosives on up to 10 transatlantic flights originating from London’s Heathrow airport. During that time, the numbers of al-Qa‘ida-affiliated groups increased. Following Bin Ladin’s death in 2011, al-Qa‘ida leaders moved quickly to name al-Zawahiri as his successor.  While al-Zawahiri leads a small but influential cadre of senior leaders widely called al-Qa‘ida Core, the group’s   cohesiveness the past three years has diminished because of leadership   losses from counterterrorism pressure in Afghanistan and Pakistan and   the rise of other organizations such as the Islamic State of Iraq and   the Levant (ISIL) that serve as an alternative for some disaffected   extremists. The 2015 deaths of Nasir al-Wahishi and Abu Khalil al-Sudani, two of al-Qa‘ida’s most experienced top leaders, has hindered the organization’s core functions.  Nonetheless, al-Qa‘ida and its affiliates in South   Asia, Africa, and the Middle East remain a resilient organization   committed to conducting attacks in the United States and against   American interests abroad. The group has advanced a number of   unsuccessful plots in the past several years, including against the   United States and Europe. This highlights al-Qa‘ida’s   ability to continue some attack preparations while under sustained   counterterrorism pressure and suggests it may be plotting additional   attacks against the United States at home or overseas. Looking ahead to 2016, al-Qa‘ida could seek to reconstitute its remnants in Afghanistan and place greater emphasis on smaller attacks against soft targets. Al-Qa‘ida continues to aspire to conduct large-scale   attacks, however, and its historical ties to Afghanistan make the   country an attractive operating area, especially if the group can   leverage its longstanding relationships with Afghan insurgents who   supported it in the years preceding 9/11.

In this system, the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âe.â For example, the name of the al-Qaâida operative who was detained on 1 March 2003 is Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; he was an associate of Usama Bin Ladin, not Osama Bin Laden. We have retained, however, the spellings used on the Rewards for Justice and FBI terrorism sites; spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules. The Islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon. The Islamic year contains 12 months, none of which can exceed 30 days. Each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon. Because 12 lunar months multiplied by 29.53 days equals 354.36 days, the Islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the Western (Gregorian) calendar. For example, 1 Muharram, the first day of Islamic year 1437 (known in the West by the Latin term Anno Hegirae, or A.H.), fell on 14 October 2015; in A.H. 1438, 1 Muharram falls on 2 October 2016. Because of lunar observation and differences in time zones, the observance of Islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region. Islamic dates and holidays are approximate, as they are determined by local lunar observation. Islamic and Jewish holidays begin the evening preceding the date shown unless stated otherwise.
