 Al-Qa‘ida in the Arabian Peninsula is a Sunni extremist group based in Yemen that has orchestrated numerous high-profile   terrorist attacks. AQAP emerged in January 2009 following the   unification of Yemeni and Saudi terrorist elements, signaling the group’s intent to serve as a hub for regional terrorism in the Arabian Peninsula. AQAP was preceded by al-Qa‘ida in Yemen (AQY), comprised of several al-Qa‘ida veterans who escaped from a Sanaa prison. AQAP’s original leadership was composed of the group’s now-deceased amir Nasir al-Wahishi; now-deceased deputy amir Sa‘id al-Shahri; and Wahishi’s successor as amir, Qasim al-Rimi. Dual US-Yemeni citizen Anwar al-Aulaqi,   who had a worldwide following as a radical ideologue and propagandist,   was the most prominent member of AQAP; he was killed in an explosion in   September 2011. Throughout 2015, AQAP has sustained rapid and cumulative   losses to its leadership ranks, including the death of Nasir al-Wahishi. Shortly after Wahishi’s death, AQAP released a video naming the group’s long-time operational commander Qasim al-Rimi as Wahishi’s successor.  The group has targeted local, US, and Western interests in the Arabian   Peninsula, as well as abroad. One of the most notable of these operations occurred when AQAP dispatched Nigerian-born Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who attempted to detonate an explosive device aboard a Northwest Airlines flight on 25 December 2009âthe first attack inside the United States by an al-Qa‘ida affiliate since 11 September 2001. That was followed by an attempt to send explosive-laden packages to the United States on 27 October 2010. In January 2015, two French nationals attacked the Charlie Hebdo magazine’s Paris office, an operation one of the attackers claimed Anwar al-Aulaqi   funded. A week after the attack, AQAP released a video on Twitter   claiming that the group chose the target and financed the operation. AQAP has also sought to expand its media presence by launching the English-language publication, Inspire magazine, in 2010.  AQAP has also undertaken a number of attacks targeting the Yemeni   Government, including a complex attack in December 2013 against Yemen’s Ministry of Defense that killed at least 52 people; and in February 2014 the group freed over two dozen prisoners from Sanaa’s   central prison. Since the Huthi rise to power in early 2015, AQAP   elements have prioritized combating Huthi expansion and regularly engage   in attacks and skirmishes with the growing Huthi presence. AQAP also   has formed a stronghold in Mukalla, Hadramawt Governorate, where it has   freed prisoners, robbed banks, and taken over government facilities. AQAP was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization on 19 January 2010.

In this system, the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âe.â For example, the name of the al-Qaâida operative who was detained on 1 March 2003 is Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; he was an associate of Usama Bin Ladin, not Osama Bin Laden. We have retained, however, the spellings used on the Rewards for Justice and FBI terrorism sites; spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules. The Islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon. The Islamic year contains 12 months, none of which can exceed 30 days. Each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon. Because 12 lunar months multiplied by 29.53 days equals 354.36 days, the Islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the Western (Gregorian) calendar. For example, 1 Muharram, the first day of Islamic year 1437 (known in the West by the Latin term Anno Hegirae, or A.H.), fell on 14 October 2015; in A.H. 1438, 1 Muharram falls on 2 October 2016. Because of lunar observation and differences in time zones, the observance of Islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region. Islamic dates and holidays are approximate, as they are determined by local lunar observation. Islamic and Jewish holidays begin the evening preceding the date shown unless stated otherwise.
