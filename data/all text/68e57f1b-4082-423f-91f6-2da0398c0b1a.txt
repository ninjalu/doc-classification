The spokesman for the Polisario Front's government in exile has accused Morocco of putting an end to the UN-mediated truce with the Western Sahara independence movement by deploying troops to the buffer zone of Guerguerat near the Mauritanian border.
"In the early hours of Friday 13 November, the occupation state of Morocco has taken the step to announce that it definitively ended the ceasefire by introducing a number of thugs in civilian garb to attack Sahrawi civilians peacefully protesting in front of the illegal breach of Guerguerat. At the same time, it took the much more dangerous step when its troops trespassed the wall of shame [a fence separating the buffer zone from Moroccan held territory] near the breach to surround and encircle the area," the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) government spokesman said in a statement carried by the Polisario's Sahara Press Service (SPS).
"This vile and desperate act was resisted by our brave people's liberation army, while our activists resisted the thugs. In summary, the battles have begun and the war that is imposed on our people has started and with it a new and decisive phase of our brave people's struggle to defend their legitimate right to freedom, dignity and sovereignty," the SADR spokesman said.
The Polisario Front called on all Sahrawi people to "firmly and bravely stand as one in order to respond to the blatant aggression and to complete the liberation of the occupied homeland".
Earlier on the same day, Morocco said that it deployed troops in the buffer zone in response to "provocation" by Polisario fighters who had blocked access to the Guerguerat zone, a gateway to neighbouring Mauritania, since 21 October.
Tensions have been high in the area since 2016. The Polisario had warned that Moroccan troops deployment would threaten the 1991 UN-brokered truce.
