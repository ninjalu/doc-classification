 Al-Qa‘ida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb is an Algeria-based   Sunni Muslim extremist group. It originally formed in 1998 as the   Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), a faction of the Armed   Islamic Group, which was the largest and most active terrorist group in   Algeria. The GSPC was renamed in January 2007 after the group officially   joined al-Qa‘ida in September 2006. The group had close to 30,000 members at its height, but the Algerian Government’s counterterrorism efforts have reduced GSPC’s ranks to fewer than 1,000. AQIM historically has operated primarily in the northern coastal areas   of Algeria and in parts of the desert regions of southern Algeria and   the Sahel, but in recent years has focused on expanding into Libya and   Tunisia. AQIM employs conventional terrorist tactics, including guerrilla-style ambushes, and mortar, rocket, and IED attacks. The group’s   principal sources of revenue include extortion, kidnapping for ransom,   and donations. In June of 2009, the group publicly claimed   responsibility for killing US citizen Christopher Leggett in Mauritania   because of his missionary activities. In 2011, a Mauritanian court   sentenced a suspected AQIM member to death and two others to prison for   the American’s murder.
                   AQIM since 2010 has failed to conduct the high-casualty attacks in Algeria that it had in previous years. Multinational counterterrorism effortsâincluding a joint French-Mauritanian raid in July 2010 against an AQIM campâresulted   in the death of some AQIM members and possibly disrupted some AQIM   activity. In 2011, however, AQIM killed two French hostages during an   attempted rescue operation, and in 2013 killed one French hostage in   retaliation for France’s military intervention in Mali.   AQIM continues to hold one South African and one Swedish hostage who   were abducted in 2011, and in June 2015 released an English language   video of the two. In 2012, AQIM took advantage of political chaos in northern Mali,   working with local Tuareg national elements to take control of major   cities, including Kidal, Gao, and Timbuktu. The Islamic militant group   Ansar al-Din was formed to support the creation of an Islamic state in Mali ruled by sharia. In 2013 AQIM suffered setbacks in northern Mali following the French-led   military intervention in the region, which caused them to lose control   of the major cities there and resulted in the deaths of a number of key   personnel. As of 2015, however, AQIM was regrouping in parts of northern   Mali and conducted a number of attacks on UN forces in the region. Since 2011, dissident groups of AQIM members broke away to form MUJAO (Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa) and al-Mulathamun Battalion and its subordinate unit al-Muwaqi‘un Bil-Dima   (“Those Who Sign With Blood”) led by former AQIM battalion leader   Mokhtar Belmokhtar. In August 2013 these groups merged to form al-Murabitun   and officially formalized the groups’ ties; their stated goals are to   “unite all Muslims from the Nile to the Atlantic in jihad against   Westerners” and to curb French influence in the region. In 2014 and 2015   additional AQIM members split from the organization to join groups   affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

In this system, the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âe.â For example, the name of the al-Qaâida operative who was detained on 1 March 2003 is Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; he was an associate of Usama Bin Ladin, not Osama Bin Laden. We have retained, however, the spellings used on the Rewards for Justice and FBI terrorism sites; spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules. The Islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon. The Islamic year contains 12 months, none of which can exceed 30 days. Each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon. Because 12 lunar months multiplied by 29.53 days equals 354.36 days, the Islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the Western (Gregorian) calendar. For example, 1 Muharram, the first day of Islamic year 1437 (known in the West by the Latin term Anno Hegirae, or A.H.), fell on 14 October 2015; in A.H. 1438, 1 Muharram falls on 2 October 2016. Because of lunar observation and differences in time zones, the observance of Islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region. Islamic dates and holidays are approximate, as they are determined by local lunar observation. Islamic and Jewish holidays begin the evening preceding the date shown unless stated otherwise.
