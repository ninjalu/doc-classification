At least six people have been killed in a suicide bombing outside a mosque in the Somalian port city of Kismayo, according to a regional official.

“A suicide bomber wearing a heavy vest of explosives targeted the Muslim congregation at the Qaadim mosque in the centre of the town as people were leaving the mosque after performing Friday prayers,” Abdinasir Gulled told the dpa news agency.

Another 20 people were injured in the attack, which may have been aimed at a provincial politician, Gulled said.
