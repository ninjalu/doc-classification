 Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, also known as Army of the Righteous, is one of the largest and most proficient of the Kashmir-focused militant groups. LT formed in the early 1990s as the military wing of Markaz-ud-Dawa-wal-Irshad, a Pakistan-based   Islamic fundamentalist missionary organization founded in the 1980s to   oppose the Soviets in Afghanistan. Since 1993, LT has conducted numerous   attacks against Indian troops and civilian targets in the disputed   Jammu and Kashmir state, as well as several high-profile   attacks inside India itself. Concern over new LT attacks in India   remains high. The United States and United Nations have designated LT an   international terrorist organization. The Pakistani Government banned   LT and froze its assets in 2002. In April 2012 two senior LT leaders   were designated by the US State Department Rewards for Justice program.   In June 2014, the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two   additional LT leaders and the US State Department amended the Foreign   Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorist   designations for LT to include four additional front organizations.  The Indian Government has charged LT with committing the 26â29   November 2008 attacks in Mumbai, in which gunmen using automatic   weapons and grenades attacked several sites, killing more than 160   people. Pakistani authorities in April 2015 released on bail the head of   LT operations, Zaki ur Rehman Lakhvi, pending prosecution of him and   several other LT leaders for the Mumbai attacks. David Headley, an   American citizen who acknowledged attending LT training camps, pleaded   guilty in March 2010 to scouting targets for the Mumbai attacks. On 21   November 2012, India executed the lone surviving Mumbai attackerâAjmal Kasab, a Pakistaniâafter the Indian Supreme Court upheld his death sentence. India has accused LT of involvement in other high-profile   attacks, including the 11 July 2006 attack on multiple Mumbai commuter   trains that killed more than 180 people. Indian authorities have   speculated that LT also may have contributed surveillance and planning   for the 13 February 2010 bombing of a German bakery in Pune, India. LT’s exact size is unknown, but the group probably   has several thousand members, predominantly Pakistani nationals seeking a   united Kashmir under Pakistani rule. The group recruits   internationally, as evidenced by the arrest in the United States of   Jubair Ahmed in 2011, Headley’s arrest in 2009, and the   indictment in 2003 of 11 LT terrorists in Virginia. In 2003, authorities   also disrupted an LT plot to attack Australia and in 2009 LT put on   hold a plot to attack Denmark in retaliation for cartoons drawn of the   Prophet Muhammad.  LT maintains facilities in Pakistan, including training camps,   schools, and medical clinics. LT coordinates its charitable activities   through its front organization, Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), which   spearheaded humanitarian relief to the victims of the October 2005   earthquake in Kashmir. JuD activities, however, have been limited since   December 2008 by the UN’s designation of the group as an alias for LT. During the 2010 floods in Pakistan, JuD and an affiliated charity, the Falah-i-Insaniyat   Foundation (FiF), were widely reported to have provided aid to flood   victims. In 2014, JuD and FiF were providing relief to internally   displaced persons in Pakistan who fled from Pakistani military   operations in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas.

In this system, the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âe.â For example, the name of the al-Qaâida operative who was detained on 1 March 2003 is Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; he was an associate of Usama Bin Ladin, not Osama Bin Laden. We have retained, however, the spellings used on the Rewards for Justice and FBI terrorism sites; spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules. The Islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon. The Islamic year contains 12 months, none of which can exceed 30 days. Each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon. Because 12 lunar months multiplied by 29.53 days equals 354.36 days, the Islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the Western (Gregorian) calendar. For example, 1 Muharram, the first day of Islamic year 1437 (known in the West by the Latin term Anno Hegirae, or A.H.), fell on 14 October 2015; in A.H. 1438, 1 Muharram falls on 2 October 2016. Because of lunar observation and differences in time zones, the observance of Islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region. Islamic dates and holidays are approximate, as they are determined by local lunar observation. Islamic and Jewish holidays begin the evening preceding the date shown unless stated otherwise.
