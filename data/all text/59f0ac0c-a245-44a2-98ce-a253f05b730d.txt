A motorbike rigged with explosives reportedly detonated, injuring "many people", in the eastern Syrian town of Hajin, which lies in the eastern Syrian province of Deir al-Zour and is controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
Citing its local reporter, Syrian Kurdish Hawar News Agency (ANHA) reported on 10 November that the explosion took place as a vehicle approached the motorbike.
It did not give an exact number of casualties or suggest who was responsible.
No group has yet been observed to claim responsibility for the bombing in key outlets, but the SDF often blames Islamic State (IS) "sleeper cells" for sporadic killings and bombings in areas under its control in Deir al-Zour province.
This latest explosion came amid an ongoing SDF campaign targeting IS underground cells in eastern Deir al-Zour. A three-member cell was reportedly captured in the town of Busayrah as part of the operation.
Hajin was one of the strongholds held by IS in eastern Syria. The SDF captured the town in December 2018, with support from the US-led international coalition.
