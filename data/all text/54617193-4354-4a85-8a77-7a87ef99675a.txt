RIGA, Nov 12 (LETA) - The Corruption Prevention Bureau has asked the Prosecutor General's Office to open a criminal case against ex-politician and the University of Latvia vice-rector Baiba Broka and businessmen Ivars Millers and Guntis Ravis.
The Corruption Prevention Bureau told LETA that it was seeking charges against one state official for taking bribes, and two businessmen for offering bribes.
The Corruption Prevention Bureau has been investigating the case since May 2018.
The bureau earlier said it had information that a public official, as a deputy chairperson of a procurement commission, could have supported certain businesspersons by accepting a bribe, which was registered as a donation to a society. The bribe amount was at least EUR 20,000. LETA reported at that time that the bribe money was registered as a donation to the Broka-led Latvian Biathlon Federation.
Before that, the Latvian Biathlon Federation received three donations of EUR 20,000 each, including from company Roadeks, which, according to Firmas.lv, is indirectly owned by Skonto Buve's beneficial owner Ravis.
