Text of report in English by website of Zimbabwean state broadcaster ZBC on 22 September

[Opposition] MDC [Movement for Democratic Change] Alliance deputy national chairperson Job Sikhala has been granted a 50,000-dollar bail.

In his bail ruling, Justice Erica Ndewere barred Sikhala from posting any audio or video material inciting violence on social media platforms.

Sikhala, who is charged with inciting public violence, had earlier been denied bail by Harare magistrates on the basis that he was arrested while hiding from law enforcement agents.

As part of his bail conditions, Sikhala must report three times weekly to the St Mary's Police Station in Chitungwiza.
