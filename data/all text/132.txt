 Hezb-e-Islami, or “Party of Islam,” is a political and   paramilitary organization in Afghanistan founded in 1976 by former   Afghan prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who has been prominent in   various Afghan conflicts since the late 1970s. Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin (HIG) is an offshoot of that original Hezb-e-Islami, and is a virulently anti-Western insurgent group whose goal is to replace the Western-backed Afghan Government with an Islamic state rooted in sharia in line with Hekmatyar’s vision of a Pashtun-dominated   Afghanistan. His group conducts attacks against Coalition forces,   Afghan Government targets, and Western interests in Afghanistan. HIG is   distinct from Hezb-e-Islami Afghanistan (HIA), a legal   Afghan political party composed of, among others, some reconciled HIG   members. HIG shares most elements of Taliban ideology and HIG insurgents   cooperate with the Taliban in some parts of Afghanistan despite some   ideological differences. Hekmatyar in July 2015 told his followers to   help Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) fighters in Afghanistan   fight the Taliban but stopped short of pledging allegiance to ISIL. HIG   spokesman Haroon Zarghoon a few days later, however, denied that any   such statement had been issued. Ever the opportunist, Hekmatyar in early   August 2015 urged the Taliban to join HIG after Mullah Omar’s death. HIG’s influence in Afghanistan started to wane in 1996,   when the Taliban assumed control of most of the country following a   series of clashes between the two groups, forcing HIG from southern   Kabul and driving Hekmatyar into exile in Iran. HIG re-emerged in Afghanistan following the US-led   operation in October 2001, and has carried out attacks on Afghan and   Coalition forces, primarily in Kunar and Nuristan Provinces. HIG also   uses Pakistan’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas and   Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province as a staging area for logistics,   fundraising, and recruitment efforts, particularly in the Shamshatu   refugee camp located near Peshawar. Hekmatyar and his deputies, Ghairat Baheer and Qutbuddin Hilal, continue   to participate sporadically in negotiations with the Afghan Government.   Hilal even ran for Afghan president in the country’s April   2014 election and in June 2015 was appointed by Afghan President Ashraf   Ghani as a special advisor for peace affairs. HIG, however, continues   to issue strongly-worded   editorials against the NATO mission in Afghanistan and against the Western-backed Afghan Government.  The group has conducted some widely publicized attacks during the past   few years. Most recently, HIG spokesman Haroon Zarghoon claimed   responsibility for a suicide VBIED attack in Kabul on 7 July 2015   against a NATO convoy. HIG also claimed responsibility for a deadly   insider attack in April 2015 in Nangarhar Province in which a US soldier   was killed. On 10 February 2014, the group executed an attack which   killed at least two US civilians and wounded two other Americans and   seven Afghan nationals. HIG was also responsible for a 16 May 2013   suicide VBIED attack in Kabul, which destroyed a US armored SUV and   killed two US soldiers, four US civilian contractors, eight Afghansâincluding two childrenâand wounded at least 37 others. The attack marked the deadliest incident against US personnel in Kabul in 2013.

In this system, the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âe.â For example, the name of the al-Qaâida operative who was detained on 1 March 2003 is Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; he was an associate of Usama Bin Ladin, not Osama Bin Laden. We have retained, however, the spellings used on the Rewards for Justice and FBI terrorism sites; spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules. The Islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon. The Islamic year contains 12 months, none of which can exceed 30 days. Each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon. Because 12 lunar months multiplied by 29.53 days equals 354.36 days, the Islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the Western (Gregorian) calendar. For example, 1 Muharram, the first day of Islamic year 1437 (known in the West by the Latin term Anno Hegirae, or A.H.), fell on 14 October 2015; in A.H. 1438, 1 Muharram falls on 2 October 2016. Because of lunar observation and differences in time zones, the observance of Islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region. Islamic dates and holidays are approximate, as they are determined by local lunar observation. Islamic and Jewish holidays begin the evening preceding the date shown unless stated otherwise.
