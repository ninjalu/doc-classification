 Al-Nusrah Front is one of the most capable al-Qa‘ida-affiliated   groups operating in Syria during the ongoing conflict. The group in   January 2012 announced its intention to overthrow Syrian President   Bashar al-Asad’s regime, and since then has mounted hundreds of insurgent-style   and suicide attacks against regime and security service targets across   the country. The group is committed not only to ousting the regime, but   also seeks to expand its reach regionally and globally. Initially, al-Nusrah Front did not publicize its links to al-Qa‘ida in Iraq or Pakistan. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) played a significant   role in founding the group. ISIL predecessor organizations used Syria as   a facilitation hub and transformed this facilitation and logistics   network into an organization capable of conducting sophisticated   explosives and firearms attacks. ISIL leaders since the beginning of al-Nusrah Front’s participation in the conflict provided their facilitation hub with personnel and resources, including money and weapons. During 2013, al-Nusrah Front and ISIL were consumed by a public rift stemming from ISIL leader AbuÂ Bakr al-Baghdadi’s April 2013 statement announcing the creation of ISIL and claiming the merger of both groups. Al-Nusrah Front and ISIL have strategies for Syria, and a public merger between them probably would have undermined al-Nusrah Front’s autonomy in the country. In April 2013, al-Nusrah Front’s leader, Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani, pledged allegiance to al-Qa‘ida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. During early 2014, the rift between al-Nusrah Front and ISILâin which ISIL has openly accused al-Qa‘ida senior leaders of deviating from what it perceives as the correct militant pathâhas taken place not just on the ground but in social media as well. Al-Nusrah Front’s   leaders probably have learned lessons from members’ previous   experiences in Iraq and have sought to win over the Syrian populace by   providing parts of the country with humanitarian assistance and basic   civil services. Several Syria-based armed opposition groups cooperate and fight alongside Sunni extremist groups, including al-Nusrah Front, and are dependent upon them for expertise, training, and weapons. Al-Nusrah Front has managed to seize territory, including military bases and infrastructure in northern Syria. The group’s cadre is predominately composed of Syrian   nationals many of whom are veterans of previous conflicts, including   the Iraq war. Thousands of fighters from around the world have traveled   to Syria since early 2012 to support oppositionist groups, and some   fighters aspire to connect with al-Nusrah Front and other extremist groups. Several Westerners have joined al-Nusrah   Front, including a few who have died in suicide operations. Western   government officials have raised concerns that capable individuals with   extremist contacts and battlefield experience could return to their home   countries to commit violent acts. An al-Nusrah Front attack in May 2014âthe first known suicide bombing by an American in Syriaâtargeted regime personnel, highlighting the involvement of US persons in the conflict.

In this system, the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âe.â For example, the name of the al-Qaâida operative who was detained on 1 March 2003 is Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; he was an associate of Usama Bin Ladin, not Osama Bin Laden. We have retained, however, the spellings used on the Rewards for Justice and FBI terrorism sites; spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules. The Islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon. The Islamic year contains 12 months, none of which can exceed 30 days. Each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon. Because 12 lunar months multiplied by 29.53 days equals 354.36 days, the Islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the Western (Gregorian) calendar. For example, 1 Muharram, the first day of Islamic year 1437 (known in the West by the Latin term Anno Hegirae, or A.H.), fell on 14 October 2015; in A.H. 1438, 1 Muharram falls on 2 October 2016. Because of lunar observation and differences in time zones, the observance of Islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region. Islamic dates and holidays are approximate, as they are determined by local lunar observation. Islamic and Jewish holidays begin the evening preceding the date shown unless stated otherwise.
