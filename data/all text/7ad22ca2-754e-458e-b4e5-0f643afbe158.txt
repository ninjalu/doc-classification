Two UNICEF planes carrying medical supplies have successfully landed at Aden International Airport according to the privately owned Al-Masdar Online news website.
The medical supplies to counter the Covid-19 pandemic in Yemen will be distributed to the most affected regions, “in light of a second wave”, the website reported on 11 November.
Among the equipment was 33 tonnes of PPE, which will be used to protect health workers on the front line.
Houthi attacks on the strategic Hudaydah port in the west of the country have made the delivery of humanitarian supplies into Yemen very difficult. In September, the foreign minister of Yemen's internationally recognised government told the UN that an agreement to spare the vital port city from violence "was no longer effective".
The problem is compounded by the fact that Yemen is reliant on imports for the vast majority of its food needs. As the local currency has collapsed, the price of available food and other essential goods has been pushed out of reach for the most vulnerable in Yemeni society.
On 11 November, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a report that famine was “stalking Yemen at a time when COVID-19 is spreading across the country”.
“By early September, more than 2,000 cases, 583 associated deaths and 1,213 recoveries had been officially confirmed, but the actual numbers are much higher, and the virus is still spreading”, it added.
