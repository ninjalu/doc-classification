Rewards for Justice The most important reasons to stop a terrorist are all around you. Stop a terrorist. Save lives. Up to $5 Million Reward Mu‘taz Numan ‘Abd Nayif Najm al-Jaburi, also known as Hajji Taysir, is a senior leader of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and a legacy member of ISIS’s predecessor organization, al-Qa’ida in Iraq (AQI). Al-Jaburi has overseen bomb-making for ISIS terrorist and insurgent activities. In June 2014, ISIS, also known as Da’esh, seized control of portions of Syria and Iraq, self-declared a so-called Islamic “caliphate,” and named al-Baghdadi as “caliph.” In recent years, ISIS has gained the allegiance of jihadist groups and radicalized individuals around the world, inspiring attacks across the globe. This reward is an important moment in our fight against ISIS. As ISIS is defeated on the battlefield, we are determined to identify and find the group’s leaders so that the global coalition of nations fighting to defeat ISIS can continue to destroy ISIS remnants and thwart its global ambitions.
