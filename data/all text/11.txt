MOGADISHU – The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) says its troops have remained steadfast and continue to implement the mission’s mandate despite reducing troop numbers early this year and the disruptions brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, a statement released Sunday said.

Early this year, AMISOM had to reduce troop numbers by 1000, spread across all the five Troop Contributing Countries, but Brig. Gen. Richard Otto, the Contingent Commander of Sector 1 troops, said this had not affected operations in his area of responsibility.

Since December 2017, AMISOM has been reducing its troop numbers in line with relevant UN Security Council decisions. Ugandan troops are in charge of Sector 1, which includes Lower Shabelle region and Mogadishu.
