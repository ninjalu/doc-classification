A US service member was injured in Somalia Monday when Al-Shabaab attacked US and Somali forces, according to the US military.

Al-Shabaab attacked the forces using “a vehicle employed as an improvised explosive device and mortar fire,” US Africa Command said in a statement. The injured service member is in stable condition and is receiving treatment for injuries that are not assessed to be life-threatening. The US military also said at least one Al-Shabaab fighter was killed during the attack.

“One U.S. service member was injured in an attack by Al-Shabaab this morning in the vicinity of Jana Cabdalle, Somalia. U.S. and Somali forces were conducting an advise, assist and accompany mission when Al-Shabaab attacked using a vehicle employed as an improvised explosive device and mortar fire,” Col. Chris Karns, director of US Africa Command Public Affairs, said in a statement.
