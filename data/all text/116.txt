The al Houthi movement in Yemen traces its roots back to a political and paramilitary group called the Believing Youth established in the mid-1990s by Hussein Badr al Din al Houthi. The Believing Youth was aligned with the pro-government al Huqq party and sought to revive Zaydism, a Shiite sect whose tenets include the belief that only descendants of the Prophet Mohammad can be legitimate Muslim rulers. After Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh aligned himself with the U.S. in 2001, Hussein al Houthi increasingly spoke out against the state, and the group held mass anti-government and anti-American demonstrations. The government issued a reward for the capture of Hussein and security forces killed him in September 2004 during an attempt to arrest him. His death ignited an uprising by his followers, who became known as the al Houthis. The al Houthi movement draws its supporters from the Zaydi Shiite population in northern Yemen and is primarily active in Sa'ada and Amran provinces. The al Houthis' grievances include economic and social marginalization, corruption in the government, close alignment of the state with the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, and excessive Wahhabi influence on state policy and schools. The al Houthi rebels do not see President Saleh as a legitimate ruler, despite the fact that he is also a Zaydi, because he is not of the Hashemite bloodline (descended from the Prophet). Hashemite Imams ruled Yemen for centuries before the 1962 coup that deposed the imamate. Al Houthi leaders, however, are quick to deny accusations that the goal of the al Houthi movement is to re-establish a Shiite imamate in the north of Yemen – an accusation the government often repeats. The al Houthi movement claims to seek autonomy from the Yemeni state for the Zaydi Shiite population in order to redress its other stated grievances. There have been multiple attempts at ceasefires and peace deals since the beginning of the conflict, but agreements have repeatedly collapsed, leading to the resumption of fighting. Most recently, the government launched a full-scale military offensive, OPERATION SCORCHED EARTH, in August 2009 in response to the al Houthi takeover of schools, hospitals, mosques, military installations, and roads in Saíada and Amran provinces. Clashes have been continuing since then and have spilled over into neighboring Saudi Arabia. Riyadh announced in the last week of January 2010 that it had defeated the al Houthi rebels in its territory and was withdrawing its forces.  Described as a "rebel stronghold" and home to Abdul Malik al Houthi[59] Operation "Blow to the Head": clearance operation in the old city of Sa'ada, sweeping house-to-house, according the government website[60] Saudi army has been fighting against the rebels for control over this border town.
