The suspect in an Islamic extremist knife attack that killed three people in a French church had a photograph on one of his mobile phones of the perpetrator of another deadly incident.
French prosecutors said the Tunisian man had images of Abdoullakh Anzorov, the Chechen refugee identified as the killer of teacher Samuel Paty who was beheaded on 16 October outside his school near Paris.

However, investigators have as yet been unable to interview the suspected church attacker, previously identified as Brahim Aouissaoui, because he remains in serious condition in hospital.
He suffered life-threatening wounds during his arrest and has since tested positive for coronavirus.

He travelled through Italy before reaching Nice less than 48 hours before the attack in the Mediterranean city's Notre Dame Basilica.
