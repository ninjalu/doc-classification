 The Haqqani Network is a Sunni Islamist militant organization founded by   Jalaluddin Haqqani, who emerged as a top Afghan warlord and insurgent   commander during the anti-Soviet war; he was a member of the Hezb-e Islami faction led by renowned mujahedin commander Younis Khalis. Jalaluddin later allied with the Afghan Taliban as that group’s Minister of Tribal and Border Affairs when the Taliban held power in Afghanistan during the mid-to-late 1990s. He was a known associate of Usama Bin Ladin and was recognized as one of Bin Ladin’s closest mentors during the al-Qa‘ida founder’s formative years in the 1980s Afghan war. Sirajuddin Haqqani, Jalaluddin’s son, currently leads the day-to-day   activities of the group, along with several of his closest relatives.   Sirajuddin in August 2015 was named as a deputy to newly appointed   Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mohammed Mansurâcementing the alliance between the Haqqanis and the Taliban. The Haqqani Network is primarily based in North Waziristan, Pakistan, and conducts cross-border   operations into eastern Afghanistan and Kabul. The group is primarily   composed of members of the Zadran tribe. The Haqqanis are considered the   most lethal and sophisticated insurgent group targeting US, Coalition,   and Afghan forces in Afghanistan; they typically conduct coordinated small-arms assaults coupled with rocket attacks, IEDs, suicide attacks, and attacks using bomb-laden vehicles. The Haqqani Network is responsible for some of the highest-profile   attacks of the Afghan war, including the June 2011 assault on the Kabul   Intercontinental Hotel, conducted jointly with the Afghan Taliban, and   two major suicide bombingsâin 2008 and 2009âagainst the Indian Embassy in Kabul. In September 2011, the Haqqanis participated in a day-long   assault against major targets in Kabul, including the US Embassy,   International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) headquarters, the Afghan   Presidential Palace, and the Afghan National Directorate of Security   headquarters. More recently, in October 2013, Afghan security forces   intercepted a truck bomb deployed by the Haqqanis against Forward   Operating Base Goode in Paktiya Province. The device, which did not   detonate, contained some 61,500 pounds of explosives and was the largest   truck bomb ever built. The group is also involved in a number of   criminal activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan, including extortion,   kidnapping for ransom, and smuggling. The US Government in 2012 designated the Haqqani Network as a Foreign   Terrorist Organization because of its involvement in the Afghan   insurgency, attacks on US military and civilian personnel and Western   interests in Afghanistan, and because of its ties to the Taliban and al-Qa‘ida.   In addition to designating the group, key members have also been   individually designated. Haqqani leaders Saidullah Jan, Yahya Haqqani,   and Muhammad Omar Zadran, as well as suicide operations chief Qari Abdul   Ra‘uf (also known as Qari Zakir), and Ibrahim Haqqani, remain either designated for financial sanctions or are on US most-wanted lists.

In this system, the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âe.â For example, the name of the al-Qaâida operative who was detained on 1 March 2003 is Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; he was an associate of Usama Bin Ladin, not Osama Bin Laden. We have retained, however, the spellings used on the Rewards for Justice and FBI terrorism sites; spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules. The Islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon. The Islamic year contains 12 months, none of which can exceed 30 days. Each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon. Because 12 lunar months multiplied by 29.53 days equals 354.36 days, the Islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the Western (Gregorian) calendar. For example, 1 Muharram, the first day of Islamic year 1437 (known in the West by the Latin term Anno Hegirae, or A.H.), fell on 14 October 2015; in A.H. 1438, 1 Muharram falls on 2 October 2016. Because of lunar observation and differences in time zones, the observance of Islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region. Islamic dates and holidays are approximate, as they are determined by local lunar observation. Islamic and Jewish holidays begin the evening preceding the date shown unless stated otherwise.
