South Asian media on Moderna vaccine announcement
Media outlets in South Asian countries largely gave factual coverage to the announcement of a new vaccine by US firm Moderna Inc, which said its vaccine was 94.5 per cent effective in preventing Covid-19.
Several Indian websites carried reports on their home pages. The LiveMint website noted "more positive news" for the second time this month. Highlighting the features of the new vaccine, a report by respected English-language paper The Indian Express said that it is "more stable than expected at temperatures that ordinary refrigerators can provide", which "opens the door for its early use in hard to reach places that might not be appropriate for Pfizer Incâ€™s vaccine which needs ultra-cold storage."
Most outlets in countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh carried agency copies describing the effectiveness, features and likely outcome of the vaccine.
