 Eight people have been arrested and weapons recovered after an investigation into disorder in West Bromwich. Officers rushed to the High Street in the town centre amid reports of young people clashing at around 4.10pm on Wednesday. The force stopped a Ford Fiesta nearby – after the people had fled – and seized combat and zombie-style knives from the vehicle. Four men – three aged 18 and a 19-year-old – have been arrested on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon. An 18-year-old woman was arrested over violent disorder. Officers later identified a second car which they believed was linked to the disorder and stopped it in Claypit Lane less than 45 minutes later. A 20-year-old woman and two boys, aged 15 and 17, were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder. They all remain in police custody. Enquiries are ongoing into the circumstances behind the disorder – and whether it is connected to a 17-year-old being stabbed on West Bromwich Ringway at around 3pm. A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: "We understand there were people who captured footage of the disorder in High Street and we would ask them to share this with us." Anyone with information has been urged to contact the force via their website, or by calling 101 and quoting log number 3381 of October 7.
