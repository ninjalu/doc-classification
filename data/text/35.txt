 The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is a terrorist organization   that has exploited the conflict in Syria and sectarian tensions in Iraq   to entrench itself in both countries. ISIL’s stated goal is   to solidify and expand its control of territory once ruled by early   Muslim caliphs and to govern through implementation of its strict   interpretation of sharia. The group’s strength and   expansionary agenda pose an increasing threat to US regional allies and   US facilities and personnel in the Middle East as well as in the West. ISILâformerly known as al-Qa‘ida in Iraq and later the Islamic State of Iraqâwas established in April 2004 by Abu Mus‘ab al-Zarqawi, who pledged his group’s   allegiance to Usama Bin Ladin. The group targeted Coalition and Iraqi   forces and civilians to pressure foreigners to leave Iraq, reduce Iraqi   popular support for the US and Iraqi Government, and attract recruits.   The group suffered a series of setbacks starting in 2007âresulting from the combination of Sunni civilian resistance and a surge in Coalition and Iraqi Government operations against the groupâbefore rebounding in late 2011 after Coalition forces withdrew, amid growing Sunni discontent with the Shia-dominated Iraqi Government. While gaining strength in Iraq, ISIL also expanded its presence in Syria and established al-Nusrah Front as a cover for its activities there. Disputes over the group’s strategic direction in Syria led to conflict and ultimately ISIL’s disavowal by al-Qa‘ida in February 2014, setting the stage for ISIL’s subsequent challenge to al-Qa‘ida for leadership of the global extremist movement. In June 2014, ISIL unilaterally declared the establishment of an   Islamic caliphate and called on all Muslims to pledge allegiance to the   group. Since then, ISIL has announced the establishment of eight   provinces outside of Iraq and Syria, including in Afghanistan and   Pakistan, Algeria, the Caucasus, Egypt, Libya, Saudi Arabia, West   Africa, and Yemen. It has also continued to attract a large number of   foreigners to Iraq and Syriaâincluding thousands of Westernersâto take part in the group’s campaign of violence and help the “caliphate” grow.  ISIL’s vast territorial safe haven in Iraq and Syria,   access to Western foreign fighters, and substantial financial resources   pose a persistent and growing threat to the United States. Since   September 2014, ISIL’s leadership has issued multiple   public calls for attacks against US and Western interests around the   world, and the group has made similar calls for attacks in its English-language magazine, Dabiq. ISIL members and sympathizers have responded by planning or conducting attacks at an unprecedented paceâat least 37 plots between February 2014 and July 2015. ISIL is also known as DA’ESH or DA’ISH, an acronym for its name in Arabic. It is currently led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, also known as Abu Du’a. The group was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization on 17 December 2004.

In this system, the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âe.â For example, the name of the al-Qaâida operative who was detained on 1 March 2003 is Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; he was an associate of Usama Bin Ladin, not Osama Bin Laden. We have retained, however, the spellings used on the Rewards for Justice and FBI terrorism sites; spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules. The Islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon. The Islamic year contains 12 months, none of which can exceed 30 days. Each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon. Because 12 lunar months multiplied by 29.53 days equals 354.36 days, the Islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the Western (Gregorian) calendar. For example, 1 Muharram, the first day of Islamic year 1437 (known in the West by the Latin term Anno Hegirae, or A.H.), fell on 14 October 2015; in A.H. 1438, 1 Muharram falls on 2 October 2016. Because of lunar observation and differences in time zones, the observance of Islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region. Islamic dates and holidays are approximate, as they are determined by local lunar observation. Islamic and Jewish holidays begin the evening preceding the date shown unless stated otherwise.
