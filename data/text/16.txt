A Yemeni media outlet reported that security forces in the governorate banned locals from carrying weapons out of fear that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) would carry out an attack in al Mahrah. Saudi-led coalition forces reportedly raided an alleged AQAP cell in al Ghaydah city, the capital of al Mahrah, on October 2.[1] The Saudi-led coalition reportedly conducted airstrikes targeting al Houthi militants in Rahba in northern Yemen’s Ma’rib governorate on October 9. Coalition forces previously targeted al Houthi militants with airstrikes in Rahba on October 5.[2] Twitter suspended al Masirah TV’s account, an al Houthi–run news outlet, for an unknown violation of the platform’s rules on October 7. Twitter officials have not yet commented on why they suspended the account.[3] UN Special Envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths called for a halt to clashes between forces aligned with the internationally recognized Yemeni government of Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi and al Houthi militants in al Hudaydah governorate on October 8.
