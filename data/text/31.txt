 The Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C) was created in 1994 when its predecessor group, Devrimci Sol or Dev Sol, splintered after factional infighting. The Marxist-Leninist group espouses an anti-US, anti-NATO, and anti-Turkish   establishment ideology and has targeted US interests intermittently for   several decades, most recently in February 2013 when a suicide bomber   targeted the US Embassy in Ankara, killing a Turkish security guard. Its   goals are the overthrow of the Turkish state, the removal of the US and   NATO footprint from Turkey, and the abolition of one- to three-man prison cells, called F-type   prisons, in Turkey. The US Department of State in April 2014 offered   rewards for information on three DHKP/C leaders through its Rewards for   Justice program. In response, DHKP/C issued a statement calling the   United States its “chief enemy.” DHKP/C added suicide bombings to its tactics in 2001, with   successful attacks against the Turkish police, in addition to improvised   explosive devices and targeted assassinations. Increased attacks in   2003 probably were a reaction to Turkey’s support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. DHKP/C entered an operational lull until mid-2012   when the group resumed attacks against Turkish police targets.   Following the February 2013 US Embassy attack, DHKP/C has continued   targeting Turkish Government and police interests, indicating that the   group remained operationally viable despite crackdowns. For example, the   group on 31 March 2015 took hostage a Turkish prosecutorâwho along with his captors was killed during a shootout with policeâand on 1 April attempted a failed suicide bombing targeting the Turkish National Police’s Istanbul headquarters. The Kurdistan People’s Congress (Kongra-Gel   or KGK, formerly the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, PKK) is a Kurdish   separatist group primarily active in part of northern Iraq and   southeastern Turkey. Composed mostly of Turkish Kurds, the group in 1984   began a campaign of armed violence, including terrorism, which resulted   in over 45,000 deaths. KGK and Turkish forces clashed repeatedly in   2011 and 2012, including an attack in October 2011 that killed 24   Turkish troops and was the deadliest incident since 1993. KGK also   stepped up its kidnapping campaign against Turkish state employees and   soldiers, which included the unprecedented abduction of a Turkish   parliamentary deputy in August 2012. The KGK’s imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, in 2012   entered into peace negotiations with the Turkish Government.   Negotiations continued into 2014, though KGK leaders expressed   frustration, charging the Turkish Government failed to establish legal   and constitutional guarantees. The accompanying cease-fire   endured despite clashes and tensions in southeast Turkey sparked in part   by the construction of Turkish military outposts that Kurdish   supporters allege undercut the peace process. Clashes in July 2015 between Turkish security forces and KGK resulted in   nationwide detentions of alleged KGK members and a wave of Turkish   airstrikes against the group’s camps and weapons stores in   northern Iraq. Renewed KGK violence against Turkish authorities had   resulted in the deaths of at least 11 police and army members as of late   July 2015.

In this system, the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âe.â For example, the name of the al-Qaâida operative who was detained on 1 March 2003 is Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; he was an associate of Usama Bin Ladin, not Osama Bin Laden. We have retained, however, the spellings used on the Rewards for Justice and FBI terrorism sites; spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules. The Islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon. The Islamic year contains 12 months, none of which can exceed 30 days. Each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon. Because 12 lunar months multiplied by 29.53 days equals 354.36 days, the Islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the Western (Gregorian) calendar. For example, 1 Muharram, the first day of Islamic year 1437 (known in the West by the Latin term Anno Hegirae, or A.H.), fell on 14 October 2015; in A.H. 1438, 1 Muharram falls on 2 October 2016. Because of lunar observation and differences in time zones, the observance of Islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region. Islamic dates and holidays are approximate, as they are determined by local lunar observation. Islamic and Jewish holidays begin the evening preceding the date shown unless stated otherwise.
