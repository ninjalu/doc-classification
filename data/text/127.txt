 Ansar al-Sharia (AAS) groups in Libya   emerged following the 2011 Libyan revolution. Their goal is to establish   sharia and to remove US and Western influence from Libya. Ansar al-Sharia   is most active in the Libyan cities of Benghazi, Darnah, Sirte, and   Ajdabiya, but most likely operates elsewhere around the country as well.   AAS works with regional extremist groups to train, conduct attacks, and   amass weapons, and actively fights Libyan security services’ efforts to   assert control throughout the country. The term Ansar al-Sharia means “Partisans of Islamic Law.” On 18 June 2015, AAS released an audio statement naming Abu Khalid al-Madani as the group’s new amir. The group’s previous leader, Muhammad al-Zawahi, was killed while fighting in Benghazi in September 2014. Following Zawahi’s death, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya benefited from the defection of multiple AAS members. Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi (AAS-B) and Ansar al-Sharia in Darnah (AAS-D)   were most likely involved in the 11 September 2012 attacks against US   facilities in Benghazi that resulted in the death of J. Christopher   Stevens, the US Ambassador to Libya, and three other US citizens. The   United States designated AAS-B and AAS-D as   Foreign Terrorist Organizations in January 2014. The groups are also   suspected of involvement in attacks and kidnappings targeting   foreigners, including an assassination of an American teacher in   Benghazi in December 2013. Ansar al-Sharia in Tunisia (AAS-T) was founded in 2011 by Saifallah Ben Hassine, also known as Abu Iyad al-Tunisi, after he was released from prison during the Tunisian revolution. In mid-2015,   Bin Hassine was tried, found guilty, and sentenced in absentia by a   Tunisian criminal court to 50 years in prison for his role in terrorist   activities. AAS-T was blamed for inciting the storming of   the US Embassy in Tunis on 14 September 2012, and has since been   designated by the United States as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. AAS-T   remains intent on conducting attacks against Western interests in spite   of increasing Tunisian security capability and counterterrorism   operations. AAS-T attempted suicide attacks against two   tourist sites in October 2013 and in 2014 probably was plotting against   Jewish targets and Western diplomatic missions in Tunisia.

In this system, the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âe.â For example, the name of the al-Qaâida operative who was detained on 1 March 2003 is Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; he was an associate of Usama Bin Ladin, not Osama Bin Laden. We have retained, however, the spellings used on the Rewards for Justice and FBI terrorism sites; spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules. The Islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon. The Islamic year contains 12 months, none of which can exceed 30 days. Each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon. Because 12 lunar months multiplied by 29.53 days equals 354.36 days, the Islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the Western (Gregorian) calendar. For example, 1 Muharram, the first day of Islamic year 1437 (known in the West by the Latin term Anno Hegirae, or A.H.), fell on 14 October 2015; in A.H. 1438, 1 Muharram falls on 2 October 2016. Because of lunar observation and differences in time zones, the observance of Islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region. Islamic dates and holidays are approximate, as they are determined by local lunar observation. Islamic and Jewish holidays begin the evening preceding the date shown unless stated otherwise.
