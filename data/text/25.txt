Hassan Baoum denounced the agreement because he believes it does not recognize the right of southern Yemenis to establish a state. He commanded his supporters to escalate activities that pushed for a southern state. The internationally recognized Yemeni government of Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Transitional Political Council of the South (STC) began implementing revised stipulations of the power-sharing Riyadh Agreement on July 29.[1] The al Houthi movement claimed shooting down a US-made surveillance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) near Jizan city in southwestern Saudi Arabia’s Jizan region on August 2. An al Houthi official reported that the downed UAV was used for surveillance and intelligence gathering. The Houthis claimed targeting Jizan city with ballistic missiles and explosive-laden drones in mid-July.[2] Hadi government-aligned forces allegedly attacked STC forces near Shaqra city in Abyan governorate on August 2. Hadi government-aligned forces exchanged artillery with STC-aligned forces in Abyan governorate on July 30.[3] The al Houthi movement reportedly released six members of the Baha’i religious community from prison on July 30. UN officials urged the Houthis to implement the release of prisoners jailed for practicing the Baha’i religion and to drop charges against other detainees in mid-April. The Baha’i faith is a monotheistic religious minority in Yemen that draws upon elements of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.[4] Horn of Africa Security Brief:  Somali National Army (SNA) forces attacked al Shabaab militants near Jamaame town in southwestern Somalia’s Lower Jubba region on August 2.
