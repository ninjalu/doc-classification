 The Taliban is a Sunni Islamist nationalist and pro-Pashtun movement founded in the early 1990s that ruled most of Afghanistan from 1996 until October 2001. The movement’s founding nucleusâthe   word “Taliban” is Pashto for “students”âwas composed of peasant farmers   and men studying Islam in Afghan and Pakistani madrasas, or religious   schools. The Taliban found a foothold and consolidated their strength in   southern Afghanistan. By 1994, the Taliban had moved their way through the south,   capturing several provinces from various armed factions who had been   fighting a civil war after the Soviet-backed Afghan government fell in 1992. By September 1996, the Taliban had captured Kabul, killed the country’s president, and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The Taliban’s first move was to institute a strict interpretation of Qur‘anic   instruction and jurisprudence. In practice, this meant often merciless   policies on the treatment of women, political opponents of any type, and   religious minorities. In the years leading up to the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, the Taliban provided a safe haven for al-Qa‘ida. This gave al-Qa‘ida   a base in which it could freely recruit, train, and deploy terrorists   to other countries. The Taliban held sway in Afghanistan until October   2001, when they were routed from power by the US-led campaign against al-Qa‘ida.  In arguably the most significant development in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region since the May 2011 death of al-Qa‘ida   founder Usama Bin Ladin, the Taliban in July 2015 revealed that its   reclusive leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, had died in 2013. Omar, who was   the president of Afghanistan during the Taliban’s rule and a   major Bin Ladin supporter, was wanted by the US Government through the   Rewards for Justice program. Mullah Akhtar Mohammed Mansur, who was Omar’s second-in-command, in early August 2015 was selected as the new Taliban leader. Mansur is only the second leader that the group has ever had.  The Afghan Taliban are responsible for most insurgent attacks in Afghanistan, which follow an established pattern of regular low-level ambush and hit-and-run attacks, coupled with periodic high-profile   attacks. The Taliban have been moving aggressively in many parts of the   country, evidenced by the fact that suicide and complex attacks   increased by 78 percent countrywide in the first six months of 2015   compared with the same period in 2014. The Taliban between 7 and 10   August 2015 conducted a series of attacks in quick succession in Kabul   that resulted in at least 60 deaths, marking the deadliest stretch in   the capital since the US-led invasion in 2001. In the first   attack, a suicide bomber detonated a large truck bomb in a residential   area while attempting to target an Afghan Defense Ministry building,   killing 15 civilians and wounding up to 400 others. On its own, the   explosion caused an unprecedented number of casualties from a single   attack in the capital in recent yearsâthe Taliban is widely   suspected of having conducted the attack although they did not claim   responsibility for it because of the massive civilian casualties. Less   than 24 hours later, over 40 cadets and civilians were killed when a   suicide bomber dressed in police uniform blew himself up at the entrance   of Kabul Police Academy. Later that day a Taliban squad targeted   Resolute Support Mission installation Camp Integrity, killing at least   nine, including one NATO serviceman. On 10 August a Taliban suicide   bomber plowed a car into a checkpoint near the entrance to Kabul   International Airport, killing at least 5 and wounding 15.

In this system, the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âe.â For example, the name of the al-Qaâida operative who was detained on 1 March 2003 is Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; he was an associate of Usama Bin Ladin, not Osama Bin Laden. We have retained, however, the spellings used on the Rewards for Justice and FBI terrorism sites; spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules. The Islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon. The Islamic year contains 12 months, none of which can exceed 30 days. Each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon. Because 12 lunar months multiplied by 29.53 days equals 354.36 days, the Islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the Western (Gregorian) calendar. For example, 1 Muharram, the first day of Islamic year 1437 (known in the West by the Latin term Anno Hegirae, or A.H.), fell on 14 October 2015; in A.H. 1438, 1 Muharram falls on 2 October 2016. Because of lunar observation and differences in time zones, the observance of Islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region. Islamic dates and holidays are approximate, as they are determined by local lunar observation. Islamic and Jewish holidays begin the evening preceding the date shown unless stated otherwise.
