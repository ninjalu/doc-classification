Servicemen of the Russian Ground Forces’ Fifth Scientific Regiment developed a system to detect the so-called suicide belts in crowded areas, using experience gained in Syria. The new system is presented at the Army-2020 international military and technical forum.

The new system includes a set of sensors, software and a mobile operator’s dashboard. It is capable of detecting suicide belts and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), stuffed with shrapnel, on large areas: at mass event venues, crowded places, checkpoints and transport infrastructure.

“If there is a suicide bomber in the crowd, the system will detect them thanks to unique radio frequency signature, characteristic only of suicide belts or IEDs.
