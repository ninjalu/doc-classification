 Boko Haram, which refers to itself as “Jama‘atu Ahl as-Sunnah li-Da‘awati wal-Jihad” (JASDJ; Group of the Sunni People for the Calling and Jihad) and “Nigerian Taliban”âother translations and variants are usedâis a Nigeria-based   group that seeks to overthrow the current Nigerian Government and   replace it with a regime based on Islamic law. It is popularly known in   Nigerian and Western media as “Boko Haram,” which means “Western   education is forbidden” (the word boko is a holdover from the colonial   English word for book). The group, which has existed in various forms   since the late 1990s, suffered setbacks in July 2009 when clashes with   Nigerian Government forces led to the deaths of hundreds of its members,   including former leader Muhammad Yusuf.  In July 2010, Boko Haram’s former second-in-command,   Abubakar Shekau, appeared in a video claiming leadership of the group   and threatening attacks on Western influences in Nigeria. Later that   month, Shekau issued a second statement expressing solidarity with al-Qa‘ida and threatening the United States. Under Shekau’s   leadership, the group has continued to demonstrate growing operational   capabilities, with an increasing use of improvised explosive device   (IED), vehicle-borne IED (VBIED), and female suicide   attacks against a wide range of targets. The group set off its first   VBIED in June 2011. On 26 August 2011, Boko Haram conducted its first   attack against a Western interestâa vehicle-bomb attack on UN headquarters in Abujaâkilling   at least 23 people and injuring more than 80. A purported Boko Haram   spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack and promised future   targeting of US and Nigerian Government interests. Boko Haram’s capability increased in 2014, with the group conducting near-daily   attacks against Christians, security and police forces, the media,   schools, politicians, and Muslims perceived as collaborators. Boko Haram   continued to raise its international profile in 2015, pledging   allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Marchâand publicly using the name “ISIL-West Africa Province” and similar variantsâand conducting simultaneous suicide bombings in N’Djamena, Chad, in Juneâthe first such attack in that country’s capital. Boko Haram’s violenceâincluding the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls in Borno State, Nigeria, in April 2014âbrought   international condemnation and in February 2015 provoked a large   regional CT offensive against the group that displaced it from the   majority of its strongholds in Nigeria. Nonetheless, Boko Haram remains   resilient, conducting attacks in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, Niger, as   well as Nigeria, emphasizing the threat it poses to Western and regional interests. The US State Department designated Boko Haram a Foreign Terrorist Organization in November 2013.

In this system, the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âe.â For example, the name of the al-Qaâida operative who was detained on 1 March 2003 is Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; he was an associate of Usama Bin Ladin, not Osama Bin Laden. We have retained, however, the spellings used on the Rewards for Justice and FBI terrorism sites; spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules. The Islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon. The Islamic year contains 12 months, none of which can exceed 30 days. Each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon. Because 12 lunar months multiplied by 29.53 days equals 354.36 days, the Islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the Western (Gregorian) calendar. For example, 1 Muharram, the first day of Islamic year 1437 (known in the West by the Latin term Anno Hegirae, or A.H.), fell on 14 October 2015; in A.H. 1438, 1 Muharram falls on 2 October 2016. Because of lunar observation and differences in time zones, the observance of Islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region. Islamic dates and holidays are approximate, as they are determined by local lunar observation. Islamic and Jewish holidays begin the evening preceding the date shown unless stated otherwise.
