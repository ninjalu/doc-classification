 The Harakat Shabaab al-Mujahidinâcommonly known as al-Shabaabâwas   the militant wing of the Somali Council of Islamic Courts that took   over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006. Despite the group’s defeat by Somali and Ethiopian forces in 2007, al-Shabaabâa clan-based insurgent and terrorist groupâhas   continued its violent insurgency in southern and central Somalia. The   group has exerted temporary and, at times, sustained control over   strategic locations in those areas by recruiting, sometimes forcibly,   regional sub-clans and their militias, using guerrilla   warfare and terrorist tactics against the Federal Government of Somalia   (FGS), African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) peacekeepers, and   nongovernmental aid organizations. Since 2011, however, pressure from   AMISOM and Ethiopian forces has largely degraded al-Shabaab’s   control, especially in Mogadishu but also in other key regions of the   country, and conflict among senior leaders has exacerbated fractures   within the group. In 2013 al-Shabaab rivalries culminated in a major purge of opponents of now-deceased group leader Ahmed Abdi Aw-Mohamed.  As evidenced by the constant levels of infighting among leadership, al-Shabaab is not centralized or monolithic in its agenda or goals. Its rank-and-file   members come from disparate clans, and the group is susceptible to clan   politics, internal divisions, and shifting alliances. Most of its   fighters are predominantly interested in the nationalistic battle   against the FGS and not supportive of global jihad. Al-Shabaab’s senior leaders remain affiliated with al-Qa‘ida. The merger of the two groups was publicly announced in February 2012 by the amir of al-Shabaab and Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of al-Qa‘ida. The group, however, has lost four senior figuresâincluding Abdiâsince September 2014, which may have hampered its communications with al-Qa‘ida leadership. Al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for many bombingsâincluding various types of suicide attacksâin   Mogadishu and in central and northern Somalia, typically targeting   Somali government officials, AMISOM, and perceived allies of the FGS.   Since 2013 al-Shabaab has launched high-profile   operations in neighboring countries, most notably the September 2013   Westgate mall attack in Nairobi,  the May 2014 attack against a   restaurant in Djibouti popular with Westerners, and the April 2015   massacre of university students in Garissa, Kenya. The Westgate attack   killed 67 Kenyan and non-Kenyan nationals, and a siege continued at the mall for several days. The Garissa attack killed some 150 mainly Christian students. Al-Shabaab is responsible for the assassination of Somali peace activists, international aid workers, numerous civil society figures, and journalists, and for blocking the delivery of aid from some Western relief agencies during the 2011 famine that killed tens of thousands of Somalis. In 2008, the US Government designated al-Shabaab   as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under Section 219 of the   Immigration and Nationality Act (as amended) and as a Specially   Designated Global Terrorist entity under Section 1(b) of Executive Order   13224 (as amended). In 2012, the Rewards for Justice program added   several al-Shabaab leaders to its site, offering large rewards for information leading to their capture.

In this system, the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âe.â For example, the name of the al-Qaâida operative who was detained on 1 March 2003 is Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; he was an associate of Usama Bin Ladin, not Osama Bin Laden. We have retained, however, the spellings used on the Rewards for Justice and FBI terrorism sites; spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules. The Islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon. The Islamic year contains 12 months, none of which can exceed 30 days. Each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon. Because 12 lunar months multiplied by 29.53 days equals 354.36 days, the Islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the Western (Gregorian) calendar. For example, 1 Muharram, the first day of Islamic year 1437 (known in the West by the Latin term Anno Hegirae, or A.H.), fell on 14 October 2015; in A.H. 1438, 1 Muharram falls on 2 October 2016. Because of lunar observation and differences in time zones, the observance of Islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region. Islamic dates and holidays are approximate, as they are determined by local lunar observation. Islamic and Jewish holidays begin the evening preceding the date shown unless stated otherwise.
