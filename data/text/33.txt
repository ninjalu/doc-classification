Abdullah was indicted and charged by a federal grand jury in November 1998 for his role in the August 7, 1998, bombings of the U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya. The attacks killed 224 civilians and wounded more than 5,000 others. In the 1990’s, Abdullah provided military training to al-Qa’ida operatives as well as Somali tribesmen who fought against U.S. forces in Mogadishu during Operation Restore Hope. From 1996-1998, he operated multiple al-Qa’ida training camps in Afghanistan.
