Rewards for Justice The most important reasons to stop a terrorist are all around you. Stop a terrorist. Save lives. Up to $10 Million Reward Al-Mawla, also known as Hajji Abdallah, is the overall leader of ISIS. He was a senior terrorist leader in ISIS’s predecessor organization, al-Qa’ida in Iraq (AQI), and steadily rose through the ranks to assume a senior leadership role as the ISIS deputy leader. As one of ISIS’s most senior ideologues, al-Mawla helped drive and justify the abduction, slaughter, and trafficking of the Yazidi religious minority in northwest Iraq and also led some of the group’s global terrorist operations. Al-Mawla became the leader of ISIS following the October 2019 death of former ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a U.S. military operation. ISIS, also known as Da’esh, had named al-Baghdadi as “caliph” in June 2014, when its forces seized control of portions of Syria and Iraq and declared a so-called Islamic “caliphate.” In recent years, ISIS has gained the allegiance of jihadist groups and radicalized individuals around the world, inspiring attacks across the globe. This reward is an important moment in our fight against ISIS and its branches and networks around the world. As ISIS is defeated on the battlefield, we are determined to identify and find the group’s leaders so that the global coalition of nations fighting to defeat ISIS can continue to destroy ISIS remnants and thwart its global ambitions. Aliases: Hajji ‘Abdallah, ‘Abdul Amir Muhammad Sa’id Salbi, Abu-‘Umar al-Turkmani Terrorist Group: Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
