Rewards for Justice The most important reasons to stop a terrorist are all around you. Stop a terrorist. Save lives. Up to $5 Million Reward Sami Jasim Muhammad al-Jaburi, also known as Hajji Hamid, is a senior leader of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and a legacy member of ISIS’s predecessor organization, al-Qa’ida in Iraq (AQI). Muhammad al-Jaburi has been instrumental in managing finances for ISIS’s terrorist operations. While serving as ISIS deputy in southern Mosul in 2014, he reportedly served as the equivalent of ISIS’s finance minister, supervising the group’s revenue-generating operations from illicit sales of oil, gas, antiquities, and minerals. The US Department of the Treasury designated him as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in September 2015, pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, which places financial sanctions on terrorists and those providing support to terrorists or acts of terrorism. In June 2014, ISIS, also known as Da’esh, seized control of portions of Syria and Iraq, self-declared a so-called Islamic “caliphate,” and named al-Baghdadi as “caliph.” In recent years, ISIS has gained the allegiance of jihadist groups and radicalized individuals around the world, inspiring attacks across the globe. This reward is an important moment in our fight against ISIS. As ISIS is defeated on the battlefield, we are determined to identify and find the group’s leaders so that the global coalition of nations fighting to defeat ISIS can continue to destroy ISIS remnants and thwart its global ambitions.
