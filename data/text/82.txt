The Egyptian military has killed 77 militants in anti-terrorism operations conducted from July 22 to August 30 in a crackdown against Islamist extremists in the northern Sinai Peninsula, the General Command of the Egyptian Armed Forces (EAF) said Sunday, cited by outlet Arab News.

Two of those militants were considered “extremely dangerous,” the report noted, as two automatic rifles, five safes and an explosive belt were found in their possession.

A total of 317 dens, hideouts and stores where explosive devices were situated, and 10 vehicles were destroyed, the EAF added.
