 The Lord’s Resistance Army is a Ugandan rebel group   currently operating in the border region of the Democratic Republic of   the Congo (DRC), the Central African Republic (CAR), and South Sudan.   Joseph Kony established the LRA in 1988 with the claim of restoring the   honor of his ethnic Acholi people and to install a government based on   his personal version of the Ten Commandments. Kony claims to channel   various spirits who direct him to oust Ugandan President Yoweri   Museveni; however, under Kony’s leadership, LRA soldiers   conduct violence for the sake of violence, primarily against civilians,   rather than fighting to advance a political agenda.  The LRA has its roots in the conflict between the Acholi tribe of   northern Uganda and other tribes in southern Uganda that began during   Idi Amin Dada’s regime (1971-1979). Power   changed hands between two equally ruthless Acholi leaders after Idi Amin   was overthrown, but the Acholi were forced to flee back to the north   when Museveni seized power in 1986. Alienated Acholi troops subsequently   formed a less extreme Holy Spirit movement to counter the Ugandan   government. However, following their defeat in 1988, a more violent movementâthe   LRAâ emerged under Kony. LRA soldiers quickly gained a reputation for   murder, torture, rape, and mutilations aimed primarily at Acholi   communities, as well as abducting tens of thousands of children over the   years to use as sex slaves and child soldiers.
                   In 2008, following Kony’s refusal to sign a negotiated   peace agreement, Ugandan, DRC, and southern Sudanese armies launched a   joint military offensive, “Operation Lightning Thunder,” against the LRA   in northeastern Congo. As a result, the LRA broke up into smaller, more   mobile groups and spread out in the border region, making them even   more difficult to locate. In May 2010 the US Congress passed the “Lord’s Resistance   Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act,” which follows the US   State Department inclusion of the LRA on the Terrorist Exclusion List   in 2001 and designation of Joseph Kony as a Specially Designated Global   Terrorist under Executive Order 13324 in 2008. In October 2011 the   United States sent a force of 100 soldiersâin an advisory roleâto   regional militaries aimed at removing Kony from the battlefield. In   March 2014 the US announced it was sending additional soldiers and   military aircraft to augment the hunt for Kony. In January 2015 Dominic Ongwen, an LRA general wanted for war crimes,   was apprehended by US forces and is awaiting trial at the International   Criminal Court in the Hague. Ongwen is one of five commanders, including   Kony, indicted by the ICC in 2005. Kony’s whereabouts are unknown, although he is believed to be hiding in Kafia Kingi, a Sudanese-controlled   enclave on the border of the CAR and South Sudan. Kony is also believed   to be in poor health. Defectors from the LRA have reported that Kony   has diabetes, while it has also been alleged the warlord has AIDS. The LRA is now thought to number between 200 and 300 fighters. In recent   years the group has carried out attacks in the DRC, South Sudan, and   the CAR. Although the group is reportedly in decline, the LRA abducted   121 people and killed at least three others between April and June 2015,   according to the UN.

In this system, the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âe.â For example, the name of the al-Qaâida operative who was detained on 1 March 2003 is Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, not Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; he was an associate of Usama Bin Ladin, not Osama Bin Laden. We have retained, however, the spellings used on the Rewards for Justice and FBI terrorism sites; spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules. The Islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon. The Islamic year contains 12 months, none of which can exceed 30 days. Each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon. Because 12 lunar months multiplied by 29.53 days equals 354.36 days, the Islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the Western (Gregorian) calendar. For example, 1 Muharram, the first day of Islamic year 1437 (known in the West by the Latin term Anno Hegirae, or A.H.), fell on 14 October 2015; in A.H. 1438, 1 Muharram falls on 2 October 2016. Because of lunar observation and differences in time zones, the observance of Islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region. Islamic dates and holidays are approximate, as they are determined by local lunar observation. Islamic and Jewish holidays begin the evening preceding the date shown unless stated otherwise.
