Heads of maritime agencies have expressed shock at the level of destruction that took place at the corporate headquarters of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) in Lagos when hoodlums hijacked a nationwide peaceful protest by youths last month. They voiced their concerns during a solidarity visit to the site of the incident. Speaking on behalf of his colleagues, the Managing Director of the National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), Dr. George Moghalu, condemned the assault, saying the level of destruction is monumental and constitutes a huge loss to the maritime community as a whole. Moghalu said: "Seeing the level of destruction here first hand, we feel very sad about the turn of events. We are all in solidarity with the NPA management. This is a great loss to the entire country and we need to educate ourselves more that violence is not the best way to go about things." He said it was a surprise to them that NPA was singled out for attack despite its documented corporate social responsibility(CSR) and community relations initiatives, many of which were tailored to youth development. In a similar vein, Director General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Bashir Jamoh, regretted that the maritime industry was made to face this challenge despite still battling with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. He said port facilities were critical national assets that should be collectively protected.
