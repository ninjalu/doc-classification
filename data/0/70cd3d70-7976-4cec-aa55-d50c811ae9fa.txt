Islamic State group (IS) has belatedly claimed to have shot dead a policeman last month on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The jihadist group made the claim in a short report in its weekly newspaper al-Naba, which was published on 12 November via IS's channels on the messaging app Telegram.
The brief claim said that on 22 October IS militants had opened fire at the policeman in central Sulawesi, allegedly killing him instantly.
No mainstream media reports of an attack in Sulawesi on that date have been observed.
The group claimed an attack on police on Indonesia's part of Borneo island in June.
IS rarely claims attacks in Indonesia, however, the group said it was behind a series of major attacks in May 2018 that included suicide bombings at three churches.
IS activity in Indonesia is assigned to the group's so-called "East Asia Province" branch, which mainly operates in the southern Philippines.
