The United Arab Emirates and Myanmar have agreed to establish diplomatic relations between their two countries.
The UAE's Permanent Representative to the UN, Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, and her Myanmarese counterpart Kyaw Moe Tun signed a joint communique to establish diplomatic relations between their countries, the state-run news agency WAM reported on 10 November.
“The communique affirms the common interest of both countries to promote mutual understanding and strengthen friendship and cooperation in the political, economic and social spheres,” the news agency said.
Nusseibeh “expressed the UAE’s keenness to collaborate with Myanmar, including through ASEAN, to unlock future partnerships in serving the aspirations of the region’s countries and peoples”.
Both diplomats also discussed the situation of the Rohingya Muslims and urged for channels of communication to be opened on this issue, adding that the Rohingya crisis is “a matter of priority for the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which the UAE currently chairs”.
In 2017, a crackdown by the Myanmar military left thousands of Rohingya Muslims dead and drove more than 700,000 to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.
