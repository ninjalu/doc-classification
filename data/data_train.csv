338,the standard yearendplanning strategy is to defer income into the next year and accelerate deductions into the current year now that joe biden has won the presidency and democrats could gain control of the senate in early january  tax planning for yearend 2020 would shift if you were to predict tax increases in 2021 for high earners however even if democrats win senate control many experts say taxlaw changes are unlikely to be a focus of biden’s first year at the same time some financial advisors and estate planners are still expecting higher taxes at some point under the biden administration what does all of this mean for yearend planning in 2020 the biden tax changes that could alter yearend planning among the different parts of biden’s tax plan  these three would have an immediate impact on 2020 yearend planning the top ordinary tax bracket rate would go back to 396 from 37 for taxpayers with income over 400000 what remains unclear is whether this income level would be different for couples married filing jointly and whether it’s 400000 in adjusted gross income ie before deductions or in taxable income if this tax hike seemed likely in 2021 it would lead to accelerating income into 2020 where possible eg receive cash bonuses before year end exercise nonqualified stock options  do roth ira conversions capital gains and qualified dividends currently have a top tax rate of 20 plus the 38 medicare surtax biden’s tax plan would change the top rate to 396 for individuals with over 1 million in income if this seemed likely to take effect in 2021 it could lead to capital gains harvesting before yearend to sell shares with substantial appreciation paying tax at the lower capital gains rate then potentially repurchasing the shares to reset the basis in them biden’s tax plan would limit itemized deductions to 28 of value with some deductions phasing out for income over 400000 that would lead to also accelerating deductions such as donations into the current year for highincome taxpayers the reverse of the usual approach when you expect higher taxes in the future to maximize them before limits put into place this concept is explained by financial advisor jeffrey levine in the kitcescom blog  tax changes not expected in 2021 in my review of client alerts and updates from wealth management tax and financial advisory firms of various sizes i found they see little chance of taxes increasing in 2021 more for you what does a biden presidency mean for your tax bill your tax transcript may look different as irs moves to protect privacy 2020 election aftermath the future of us tax policy northern trust  “we expect an agreement on some fiscal stimulus while tax increases are off the table the most likely outcome is divided government that will significantly limit policy” pwc  “a republicancontrolled senate would largely eliminate the prospect of any significant tax increases until at least after the 2022 midterm elections if democrats do win an operational senate majority with the tiebreaking vote of a vice president harris the outlook for action on biden’s tax plans could be put into question because of the challenges of operating in an evenly divided senate” grant thornton  “while it is always possible that democrats win both runoffs in georgia and immediately pursue tax increases with senate control it would be surprising key democrats have already indicated their first priority will be legislation battling covid19 and offering economic relief and have signaled a reluctance to raise taxes while the economy is fragile taxpayers should exercise serious caution before using planning strategies that would accelerate income in anticipation of tax increases that appear increasingly unlikely to happen immediately” manning  napier fairport ny “significant changes to tax policy are always difficult to pass even in times of united oneparty control given current projections for a divided federal government we believe the odds of tax reform have become even less likely in our view it is difficult to see how the varied political interests in washington dc would be able to come together on a topic this controversial” mark mazur the director of the urbanbrookings tax policy center predicts in an article at the website law360 that president biden will “punt” negotiations on tax cuts  jobs act provisions that expire at the end of 2025 into the next congress he thinks that biden will instead focus on other priorities in his campaign platform theres no need to decide in 2021 what the tax code of 2026 will look like mazur told law360  analysts from the urban institute recently updated their analysis of the biden tax proposals they do not foresee an effective date for new tax provisions any earlier than january 1 2022 the possible reasons for this delay are explained by john p barringer managing partner of executive wealth planning partners in denver colorado in an article at mystockoptionscom  stockbrokers secrets yearend planning for nqsos restricted stock and rsus  “even if the democrats eventually gain control of three branches of the federal government tax changes are not likely to be the first thing on their agenda” he writes “over the last two years the democratic majority in the house of representatives has passed hundreds of bills to address climate change racial inequality police reform and voting rights that stack of bills would be the first thing the senate would want to review if party power changed so with everything a new administration and congress will have on their todo list regardless of the eventual outcome in each chamber tax changes are unlikely to be addressed until at least 2022” what financial advisors tax pros and lawyers are recommending in its article grant thornton says you should “be very cautious about rushing transactions or asset sales in ways that forfeit value especially as immediate tax increases now look much less likely income and tax acceleration strategies should also be balanced against liquidity needs during this period of economic disruption and only after considering the time value of money” given the very low interest rates on money saved in the bank that you could apply to paying taxes an article by cpa and financial advisor craig richards of fiduciary trust company international raises the question of whether “it may be worth taking the chance” to accelerate income into this year if you are concerned about higher future taxes jonathan gassman a cpa and the ceofounder of accounting and wealth management firm gassman financial group new york emphasized to me that financial planning is very client and factspecific “the election results have not changed my multiyear planning” he explained “our theme for most clients continues to be accelerate income and accelerate charitable contributions of highly appreciated stock to get the deductions this year as they could be curtailed” he still thinks that taxes will be going up at some point if not in 2021 then in the next few years this view is shared by some of the other financial tax and legal advisors i reached out to randy joseph a cpa with the taxadvisory firm joseph  hetrick seattle also takes a multiyearplanning approach that goes beyond what tax rates might be in 2021 “we are cautiously discussing accelerating income and discussing the fact that no one knows what will happen it’s such a crap shoot” joseph m schmerling a financial advisor and cpa with schmerling financial group jenkintown pa and silver spring md explained to me that yearend tax planning 2020 is different for many reasons these include not just the tax proposals of presidentelect joe biden but also the impact of covid19 “our approach is to get ahead of disruptions by reviewing our clients plans and stress test the possible outcomes ultimately we are looking for solutions that make sense even within the current fiscal environment” he said “we are not willing to derail the financial progress we’ve made on speculation” estate and gift planning the lifetime exemption amount for gift estate and generationskipping transfer taxes increased in 2020 to 1158 million per person 2316 million for married couples lauren galbraith an attorney with the law firm farella braun  martel in california explained in a preelection article that by making gifts now you can lock in the current amount of the exemption which may shrink in 2026 to about half those amounts—or perhaps even sooner depending on voting results see estate tax planning for large company stock holdings four tips for using recordhigh lifetime exemptions  now after the election she told me this change is probably not coming in 2021 “i do think that the urgency has fizzled and estate and gift tax changes effective retroactive to january 1 2021 at this point seem highly improbable those who are on the margins in terms of whether they want to make significant gifts now may be best advised to hold off and take a waitandsee approach” bob keepler a cpa with the tax advisory firm keebler  associates green bay wi calculates using basic probability a 25 chance ie 50 x 50 that the democrats could take control of the senate after the georgia runoff elections rather than trying to “see through the fog” his wealthy clients with substantial assets are going forward and still making gifts to reduce the size of their estates he believes that if tax changes do not happen in 2021 they may still occur after the midterm elections in 2022 as 21 of the 34

78,warfaretoday at the heart of the fighting soldiers launch mutinies in three ivory coast cities west african nation’s defence minister says the mutineers are demanding salary increases and payment of bonuses   al jazeera reported on 6 january 2017 that ivorian soldiers had mutinied in three cities across the country the trouble began in bouake the country’s secondlargest city and former rebel stronghold before spreading to two other major urban centres of daloa and korhogo nicolas haque reporting from dakar in senegal for al jazeera said these are former soldiers that were part of an ecowas force trying to maintain peace in liberia then they returned back to ivory coast where there was also a civil war and played a role to maintain peace and order in the country now they are saying they weren’t paid for their services in bouake during the civil war we saw heavy bombardment from government authorities we saw mass graves there are a lot of young men with arms there heavy firing was reported continuing into 7 january with mutineers still in control of bouake and unrest spreading to abidjan and other cities despite what appeared to be successful negotiations with the government soldiers opened fire on a building in bouake where the ivorian defence minister alainrichard donwahi was staying journalist ange aboa was inside the building at the time and said that soldiers opened fire with assault rifles and rpgs the siege was reported to have ended on 8 january and donwahi was allowed to leave unharmed the president of ivory coast alassane ouattara appeared on television to agree to the mutineers demands after peace was restored ivorian prime minister daniel kablan duncan resigned and dissolved the government a move that had been expected but delayed by the twoday mutiny ouattara then dismissed several highranking officials chief of the army general soumaila bakayoko superior commander of the national gendarmerie gervais kouakou kouassi and the directorgeneral of the national police bredou m’bia one source was reported as saying that the soldiers had originally demanded a pay increase of 16000 about 100 times more than the average ivorian earns per month the final amount agreed was said to be approx 8000 each to be paid as a oneoff bonus it is not certain whether the government will be able to afford this amount on 17 january reuters reported that at least two soldiers had been killed in a further outbreak of violence ange aboa said that the men were shot in the capital yamoussoukro hours after the government had started paying the promised bonuses unconfirmed reports said that a further 6 men were killed in bouake aboa also said that the deal involved bonus payments of 12 million cfa francs 19595 each to approximately 8400 soldiers beginning with an installment of 5 million the shootings occurred as other soldiers demanded to be included in the deal soldiers in abidjan and other cities were involved in fresh protests on 23 january men described as ‘retired soldiers’ blockaded one of the major highways into abidjan as civilians also came out in protest firemen blocked roads and secondaryschool teachers went on strike demanding better pay it is also believed that the soldiers are demanding to be included in the bonuspayment deal with the mutineers the situation has seen ivory coast bond prices crashing and cocoa exports piling up in abidjan’s port economic problems will hit ouattara’s ability to meet payment demands ivory coast côte d’ivoire is a country of 322463km2 located in west africa ivory coast’s

wars in 20022007 and 20102011 beyond the largescale conflicts ivory coast has witnessed armed confrontation for decades calling it ‘tactical communication’ researcher dr maggie dwyer charted 9 mutinies from 1990 to 2008pdf and the country has seen continuing trouble since the last civil war officially ended in 2011 in 2014 striking soldiers also complaining about nonpayment brought the

coast’s armed forces known officially as the forces republicaines de cote d’ivoire frci vary considerably bloomberg reported a strength of 40000 men al jazeera’s latest estimate puts the size of the army at 22000 men although other sources put the figure at 9500 the international institute for strategic studies assessed that in 2012 the ivorian army had 10 sovietera t55 tanks potentially unserviceable 5 french amx13 light tanks 34 reconnaissance vehicles 10 soviet bmp12 armoured infantry fighting vehicles 41 wheeled apcs and over 36 artillery pieces in 2012 the ivory coast airforce consisted of one soviet mil mi24 helicopter gunship and three french sa330l puma transports potentially unserviceable a minimal coastal patrol capability was reported for the ivory coast navy soldiers’ demands over money are likely to be a recurrent problem the capacity for the government to appease the mutineers will be stretched as more soldiers make demands however underlying the recent unrest is a clear demarcation between the mutineers many of them former forces nouvelles rebels operating out of their stronghold of bouake and the current leadership under the ageing ouattara now 75

as “boko haram” which means “western   education is forbidden” the word boko is a holdover from the colonial   english word for book the group which has existed in various forms   since the late 1990s suffered setbacks in july 2009 when clashes with   nigerian government forces led to the deaths of hundreds of its members   including former leader muhammad yusuf  in july 2010 boko haram’s former secondincommand   abubakar shekau appeared in a video claiming leadership of the group   and threatening attacks on western influences in nigeria later that   month shekau issued a second statement expressing solidarity with alqa‘ida and threatening the united states under shekau’s   leadership the group has continued to demonstrate growing operational   capabilities with an increasing use of

allegiance to the islamic state in iraq and the levant isil in marchâand publicly using the name “isilwest africa province” and similar variantsâand conducting simultaneous suicide bombings in n’djamena chad in juneâthe first such attack in that country’s capital boko haram’s violenceâincluding the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls in borno state nigeria in april 2014âbrought

64,by isabel ivanescu and ezgi yazici key takeaway competition between russia and turkey continued to escalate in 2020 the parties redoubled their commitments to opposing sides in syria and libya and turkey opened a new theater of competition in the caucasus each of these conflicts is unique and discrete but must be understood within the crosstheater dynamics of russiaturkey competition click here to expand the map below  russia and turkey are supporting belligerents on opposite sides of three conflicts – in syria in libya and in nagornokarabakh – and are competing for influence in the black sea and the mediterranean russiaturkey competition is not a new phenomenon but has escalated as both countries have adopted more ambitious foreign policy objectives and expanded their regional influence in the past decade the situation in syria is precarious syria remains a priority effort for both russia and turkey while the two parties are increasingly at odds turkey views syria as core to its national security fearing both a renewed refugee influx and autonomous kurdish governance on the turkish border for russia syria is a critical venue for projecting power in the middle east and mediterranean and pressuring the united states turkish occupation of swathes of northern syria and russian freedom of action throughout regimeheld areas has resulted in a shaky balance turkey and russia have been facing off in oppositionheld greater idlib to pressuring one another into a negotiated settlement since midseptember 20201 turkish and russian proxies are also manning opposing but stable front lines in syria’s northeast moscow or ankara must alter this balance through diplomacy or force if either is to achieve its objectives the russian air force carried out one of the deadliestever russian airstrikes in syria targeting a turkish proxy in idlib on october 26 in a possible play to shift the situation in syria or impose costs on turkey for actions elsewhere2 russia and turkey back opposing parties in libya and will likely remain militarily engaged despite a recent ceasefire turkey intervened in libya in january 2020 to halt the advance of forces backed by geopolitical opponents egypt the united arab emirates and russia on tripoli while carving out a turkish maritime sphere of influence in the eastern mediterranean turkey’s intervention derailed russia’s campaign in libya but produced intensified russian engagement the kremlin remains committed to establishing permanent russian basing and access to libya’s oil supply even amid constraints imposed by russia’s own local partners and regional allies russia and turkey are locked in an armed race for influence in libya below the level of outright conflict the parties are unlikely to pull away from libya even while a purported “permanent ceasefire” signed by their respective local partners on october 23 calls for the withdrawal of all foreign forces3 recent hostilities in nagornokarabakh are both born of and further fueling russiaturkey competition turkey coordinated with azerbaijan to reignite the longstanding conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over disputed territory nagornokarabakh in september4 ankara sees the conflict as a lowcost opportunity to solidify a turkish foothold in the caucasus and challenge growing bilateral ties between baku and moscow while profiting from arms sales to azerbaijan russia brokered two failed ceasefires since fighting began in september 2020 in a bid to keep both armenia and azerbaijan within its sphere of influence the kremlin seeks rapid deescalation in nagornokarabakh with minimum russian investment russia’s neutrality is an opportunity for ankara to cash in rapid azerbaijani territorial gains for regional influence without triggering a russian escalation a new ceasefire—brokered by the us without russian involvement—went into effect on october 26 with both armenian and azerbaijani violations reported within hours5  the kremlin may attempt to compel a resolution by force in response to turkey’s growing military role and the united states’ growing diplomatic role in the conflict reasserting russia’s role as the sole powerbroker in the caucasus isw has not observed indicators of an imminent russian deployment to armenia however developments in syria libya and nagornokarabakh cannot be analyzed in a vacuum but must instead be contextualized in the landscape of crosstheater russiaturkey competition the two revisionist powers will likely continue to search for a comparative advantage including by establishing new and advantageous theaters for competition or further investing in existing theaters seemingly inexplicable russian or turkish decisions in one theater may be readily understandable when considered alongside developments in another theater a russian or turkish decision to commit resources in a new area if not obviously compatible with policy objectives may well result from a

188,as of 20 january the united states should have a new president as joe biden takes over from donald trump decisions taken in washington have for the last 20 years been fundamental to what happens in afghanistan and that is especially the case now biden takes power in the wake of president trump’s decision to negotiate with the taleban and agree to troop withdrawal this has already transformed both the usafghan relationship and the relative power of the taleban and the afghan government aan’s kate clark with input from rachel reid assesses what policy paths will still be open to biden when he takes office and explores what a biden presidency might mean for afghanistan  us presidentelect makes headline news in kabul on 8 november 2020 photo wakil khosarafp for 20 years us financial and military support has been the mainstay of posttaleban governments in afghanistan for most of that period the us was the implacable enemy of the taleban but during the trump administration us policy changed radically it has dealt unilaterally with the taleban and come to a bilateral agreement with the movement which committed the us to troop withdrawal  since the signing of the ustaleban agreement in doha on 29 february 2020 the us has fulfilled its promise to bring troop numbers down from about 13000 to 8600 by june trump has since gone further with an election campaign promise to reduce numbers further to 4500 by november according to the ustaleban agreement all foreign forces should have left afghanistan by 30 april 2021 although this is conditional on the taleban’s “commitment and action on the obligations” outlined in the agreement specifically not to threaten the us or its allies or allow other groups including alqaeda to use afghan soil to do this the afghan government which was not party to the agreement has also abided by a us promise to the taleban that it would release 5000 taleban prisoners in exchange for 1000 government prisoners held by the taleban intraafghan talks also began on 12 september although with no progress so far on agreeing either an agenda or protocol  the doha agreement has resulted in major changes to the conflict the us stopped attacking the taleban although it retains the right to defend the afghan national security forces ansf who have themselves moved to a largely defensive stance the taleban have ceased attacking foreign targets but contest us claims that they agreed to an overall reduction in violence they have launched more attacks against afghans both civilian and military than last year unclaimed insurgent attacks especially in urban areas have also increased these also look to be mostly talebanauthored the net result of the doha agreement is thus the us largely leaving the battlefield the taleban emboldened and the ansf demoralised and still looking to the us for support as in helmand last month in the face of a major taleban offensive  the support given by the us to the afghan state since 2001 has not just been military the government is highly dependent on international financial support the bulk of it from the us international assistance funds about 75 per cent of the government’s budget as well as comprising a significant part of national income that dependency has only increased this year because of the covid19 pandemic the ensuing fall in government revenues has created a budget deficit of more than 800 million usd for 2020 on top of the enormous existing structural budget deficit and has worsened afghanistan’s already high poverty rate from just over half to an estimated twothirds of the population now living below the poverty line this together with the possible complete withdrawal of and associated spending by foreign forces early next year should have made the international conference on aid due now to take place virtually on 23 and 24 november even more important than usual however what it will actually be able to decide is debateable given the political turmoil in washington caused by trump’s refusal to accept he lost the election  all of this means that trump will leave the white house with american policy towards afghanistan substantially changed with the kabul government still very dependent on foreign support and with the fate of the country very much in flux  what has been biden’s approach to afghanistan  biden steps into the presidency with a long foreign policy track record as a senator who chaired the committee on foreign relations and then barack obama’s vice president  while a gradual troop withdrawal from afghanistan was always the longerterm aim of the obama administration for years president obama was persuaded into a more military interventionist approach of counterinsurgency twinned with record levels of foreign assistance lively debates about this approach raged for many years within the obama administration during which biden was positioned as the “inhouse pessimist” he compared afghanistan to the ‘quagmire’ of vietnam and was a persistent critic of general stanley mcchrystal and general david petraeus’ counterinsurgency approach in particular the 100000 strong us troop surge of 200912 instead he argued for a light footprint counterterrorism policy  so what can be expected from biden as president afghanistan was barely mentioned in the election campaign by either side this was also the case in 2016 – it is many years since afghanistan was a us foreign policy priority even so biden has made some remarks which can give a flavour of what he may be contemplating on important decisions ahead concerning the final troop withdrawal and intraafghan talks  in a long piece for foreign affairs “why america must lead again rescuing us foreign policy after trump” published in marchapril 2020 biden laid out his vision for foreign policy he stressed an internationalist approach and working with other liberal democracies and allies in collective action he mentioned afghanistan just twice and both times it was bundled up with other countries the first mention implied dissatisfaction with the lack of concessions won by the us in its deal with the taleban  trump has emboldened our adversaries and squandered our leverage to contend with national security challenges from north korea to iran from syria to afghanistan to venezuela with practically nothing to show for it  the second reiterated his favoured doctrine of avoiding openended military engagement  it is past time to end the forever wars which have cost the united states untold blood and treasure as i have long argued we should bring the vast majority of our troops home from the wars in afghanistan and the middle east and narrowly define our mission as defeating al qaeda and the islamic state or isis… we must maintain our focus on counterterrorism around the world and at home but staying entrenched in unwinnable conflicts drains our capacity to lead on other issues that require our attention and it prevents us from rebuilding the other instruments of american power  we can be strong and smart at the same time there is a big difference between largescale openended deployments of tens of thousands of american combat troops which must end and using a few hundred special forces soldiers and intelligence assets to support local partners against a common enemy those smallerscale missions are sustainable militarily economically and politically and they advance the national interest  an important additional detail is found in a recent stars and stripes interview published on 10 september 2020 a day after trump announced his decision to reduce troop numbers in afghanistan and iraq ahead of the election biden hinted at the desirability of leaving a small contingent of special forces in afghanistan  “these ‘forever wars’ have to end i support drawing down the troops but here’s the problem we still have to worry about terrorism and the islamic state” biden told stars and stripes in a telephone interview  biden said conditions in syria afghanistan and iraq are so complicated that he cannot promise full withdrawal of troops in the near future  however he supports a small us military footprint whose primary mission would be to facilitate special operations against the islamic state or isis and other terror organizations  “i think we need special ops capacity to coordinate with our allies” biden said adding there should be a maximum of “1500 to 2000” on the ground a smaller force that what he would likely inherit from trump  however biden said the military should not meddle in the political dynamics of the countries where they operate he said us forces must be able to coordinate with allies to train and lead to “take out terrorist groups who are going to continue to emerge”  biden’s scepticism about foreign intervention is one which he came to according to greg jaffe writing in the washington post partly because of the “sobering experiences” of the wars in iraq and afghanistan as senator he had on occasion taken a more interventionist approach including in the balkans in the 1990s after 911 he became an important ally for the bush administration’s ‘war on terror’ including its invasion of iraq which he voted for he also called on the bush administration to devote more money and troops to afghanistan however a trip to kabul in february 2008 seems to have been the beginning of his disillusionment with us policy ­– not least because of a now infamous dinner with then president hamed karzai which biden stormed out of infuriated by karzai’s denials of corruption by the time obama took office in 2009 and biden became vice president he had become the primary opponent of deepening engagement especially the surge by that time jaffe reported biden did not believe the rosy assessments of the war by us generals and diplomats in kabul rather he viewed the karzai administration and the ansf as venal corrupt ineffective and unreliable and the war against the taleban as unwinnable  in the 1990s biden had made an impassioned argument that us credibility and the country’s moral standing demanded that it use military force to stop a slaughter in the balkans in afghanistan biden rejected the notion that america had any moral obligation to improve the lives of afghans or prevent civil wars “he had that empathy for the people in the balkans he even had it for people in iraq” said a senior obama administration official who requested anonymity to speak candidly “i never saw it in afghanistan”  biden also famously resisted efforts to tie us engagement to any duty to protect afghan women in 2010 when biden was vicepresident and with a son in the military he met then us special envoy to afghanistan and pakistan richard holbrooke who recorded this choice quote “i am not sending my boy back there to risk his life on behalf of women’s rights it just won’t work that’s not what they’re there for”   smoke rises from an american airstrike against a presumed iskp fighting position seen from us combat outpost blackfish in mamand valley nangrahar such scenes could soon be a thing of the past if us troop withdrawal goes ahead in 2021  photo andrew quilty april 2018 a biden policy on afghanistan  drawing together what biden has said about afghanistan in particular and his foreign policy approach in general a couple of conclusions can be drawn first in terms of style he will be steadier and more predictable than trump us staffers and the military will no longer fear policy on afghanistan being turned on its head by an early morning presidential tweet there will be an end to what biden described in his foreign affairs article to trump’s “turning on our own intelligence professionals diplomats and troops” instead from 20 january there should be more consultation between the white house and senior civilian aides and the military  secondly biden who also condemned trump for how he “belittled undermined and in some cases abandoned us allies and partners” will be more multilateralist the us will remain the prime decisionmaker among countries supporting kabul – and there is no reason to think other countries will not continue to follow its lead whatever that is – but there should now be more discussion with allies or at least warnings of imminent policy changes  as to how biden will approach the doha agreement and us military deployment as it became clear biden had won the us election messages from president ashraf ghani and the taleban hinted at what each party hoped and feared ghani congratulating the new us president and vice president on 8 november appeared to hope for continuing us support and perhaps a counterterrorism force to be left behind  afghanistan looks forward to deepening our multilayered strategic partnership with the united states our foundational partner including in counterterrorism and bringing peace to afghanistan  a day later vicepresident sarwar danesh called for the incoming administration to conduct a “full review” of the peace process and “apply more pressure on the taliban to reduce their violence”  meanwhile the taleban who had been reported as hoping trump would win the election though spokesman zabihullah mujahed later said his words had been misrepresented gave a statement on 10 november describing the us election and transition to the new administration as an “internal issue” and without ever naming biden the statement said the doha agreement must be implemented the statement sought to portray the taleban as peaceloving giving assurances that they would not allow afghanistan “to threaten america” that they sought “positive relations with all countries of the world including america in the future” and that their “preference” was “to solve our internal problems through dialogue and negotiations” they warned the “future american president” to be vigilant against “warmongering circles individuals and groups that seek to perpetuate the war and to keep america mired in conflict in order to pursue their own personal interests and hold over power”  such conciliatory sentiments were wholly at odds with those voiced by spokesman mujahed just two weeks previously on 24 october when he said that after us forces had been forced to leave the ‘jihad’ would continue in fact it would be mandatory he said “until the rule of islam takes hold in our homeland” he promised that the taleban would continue to kill “all troops and workers serving in the kabul administration” as long as they “do not repent and accept an islamic system” the taleban’s assurances that they want to solve afghanistan’s problems through dialogue or that they even have a preference to negotiate a political end to the war cannot be relied upon  it is possible that a change in leadership in washington could result in more engagement by us negotiators in the intraafghan talks to try to push the two parties towards a peace settlement although the question would also be whether either side actually wants to compromise the delays over even settling an agenda and protocol are not promising there is also discussion in policy circles over whether biden will replace chief negotiator zalmay khalilzad a neoconservative and longterm republican who has remained close to and trusted by both trump and secretary of state mike pompeo however his fate seems less relevant than the circumstances either he or his successor would now face biden for one seems fully aware of how much has already been given away by the united states when he wrote in foreign affairs that trump has “emboldened our adversaries and squandered our leverage to contend with national security challenges… with practically nothing to show for it” khalilzad has indeed given away most of the us and by extension the afghan government’s bargaining chips just to get the taleban to the table the taleban have already been rewarded with prisoner releases partial us troop withdrawal and international legitimacy in return for giving up almost nothing  it seems highly unlikely that the us would at this point abandon or try to renegotiate the doha agreement even though the kabul administration might hope for this it does still have some leverage left – the threat of not going through with the full withdrawal and the promise of financial support if the taleban reach a settlement – but its clout is much reduced compared to its position before khalilzad started negotiations even if biden and his administration make no public comments about us troop levels which would be more helpful than trump tweeting about bringing troops home by christmas 1 the taleban may still feel they only have to push at an open door  america does not need the taleban’s permission to stay in afghanistan the author has been told several times by us officials in relation to the 30 april 2021 deadline full withdrawal is anyway contingent on the us deciding the taleban have upheld their side of the agreement biden’s assertion in his recent stars and stripes interview that conditions in afghanistan as in syria and iraq were so complicated he could not promise the full withdrawal of troops in the near future suggests the april deadline could slip or he may be considering leaving a residual counterterrorism ct force in afghanistan this is not allowed for under the doha agreement and would either have to be negotiated with the taleban or established despite their objections that would carry the risk of the taleban renewing their attacks on urban centres and foreign targets and their abandoning the intraafghan talks would the us risk unravelling its agreement with the taleban for the sake of having a ct force on the ground and given that a ct force would need a relatively stable afghanistan to operate in and effective local partners to work with if talks did break down and a fullblown war did resume unless us forces were weighing in on the side of the ansf the prospects of that necessary stability would look much less assured yet resuming us offensive support to the ansf would mean a return to the predoha status quo and with no greater likelihood of the ansf or the kabul government becoming any less dependent or there being an better time to leave it is difficult to see this prospect as in any way enticing to the incoming president  if there is a complete us withdrawal and the taleban never actually had any real desire to negotiate with kabul and are actually intent on pushing for military victory the us would be seen as having failed in afghanistan it would risk alqaeda and other jihadist groups taking encouragement from the superpower’s ‘defeat’ and gaining practical benefits from the reestablishment of a safe haven for afghans the prospect of reinvigorated civil war is horrible to contemplate  there are two other issues related to afghanistan both more positive that should also be mentioned on iran biden has signalled that the us will rejoin the iran nuclear deal reached during the obama presidency which trump pulled out of in 2018 2 trump may try to add new sanctions on iran before leaving office to try to foil any such rapprochement but if biden can manage to establish a less antagonistic usiran relationship that would help ease kabul’s position caught as it has been in the hostility between its important neighbour and prime ally other us bilateral relationships important to afghanistan with russia china and pakistan might be just as tricky under biden as under trump but biden would at least deal with these countries in a more orthodox and less haphazard way that could just conceivably help afghanistan live more in its region less dependent on relationships with faraway countries but it is a scenario that relies on imagining a country more at peace in the 1990s the neighbours helped fuel civil war  secondly those in us human rights circles expect biden to drop sanctions against senior staff at the international criminal court which were imposed by trump on 2 september 2020 they were aimed at stopping the court “targeting americans” as secretary of state pompeo put it and were brought in after the court decided to investigate potential war crimes and crimes against humanity in afghanistan since 2003 these include the use of torture by the cia and us military including in relation to the cia’s rendition programme see this aan backgrounder   afghan border forces fighting in maidanshah district against taleban fighters just 200 metres away in september 2019 photo andrew quilty conclusion  before the extent of trump’s ‘america first’ policies were made clear many afghans who feared the prospect of a us withdrawal were optimistic that a return to a republican administration might make the us a more steadfast ally for afghanistan trump’s populist isolationism and haphazard approach to decisionmaking eventually disabused them of that hope while obama’s drive to take american out of an ‘endless war’ footing was more principled he and trump broadly converged on the goal of troop withdrawal biden has long advocated a light footprint which seems to be where he remains today what has changed are the conditions of the doha agreement that may prevent even the lightest ct footprint  much has been made of foreign policy’s reporting on the team of 2000 foreign policy and national security advisors amassed by joe biden they will be receiving suggestions and recommendations from many corners of washington and the world on afghanistan advising biden what he ought to do or reminding him of the obligations some feel he should have for a country whose government the us toppled and whose fate it then got tangled up in however biden will have strong ideas of his own on afghanistan policy as will some of the familiar names being touted for top cabinet posts  moreover times are very different from when he and barack obama took power over a decade ago in their first year in office when obama announced the surge it was because he was persuaded that what happened in afghanistan and pakistan had a fundamental impact on the security of the united states it is worth giving a long quote from his speech delivered on 1 december 2009 as it underlies just how much has changed in us views of afghanistan  i am convinced that our security is at stake in afghanistan and pakistan this is the epicenter of violent extremism practiced by al qaeda it is from here that we were attacked on 911 and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as i speak this is no idle danger no hypothetical threat in the last few months alone we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of afghanistan and pakistan to commit new acts of terror and this danger will only grow if the region slides backwards and al qaeda can operate with impunity we must keep the pressure on al qaeda and to do that we must increase the stability and capacity of our partners in the region  as for the taleban obama said the movement had maintained “common cause with alqaeda as they both seek an overthrow of the afghan government” the us had to “reverse the taliban’s momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow the government”  the prospect of alqaeda reestablishing itself and the taleban again ruling afghanistan has not gone away yet in biden’s foreign policy article and stars and stripes interview he made no mention of the taleban and referred to alqaeda just once afghanistan will not be a priority for joe biden when he takes power other policy decisions – the covid19 pandemic and the domestic economy as well as a whole host of other foreign policy issues – are far more pressing afghanistan is simply not that important to america any more  washington’s decisions still remain fundamental to what happens in afghanistan and for many afghans the need for action from the us may feel urgent given the 30 april deadline and the intensification of the conflict yet what room biden has to reset us policy on afghanistan will be limited not only by his inheritance of the ustaleban deal but also his own inclinations  edited by rachel reid  references ↑ 1	trump’s preelection 8 october tweet had promised that “our brave men and women serving in afghanistan” should be “home by christmas” officials were quick to point out at the time that they had received no orders in this regard the suggestion of a possible quick troop withdrawal before trump leaves office in january – which would cement his legacy as the president who brought the troops home – resurfaced with the appointment of a proquick withdrawal retired army colonel douglas macgregor as senior advisor to the newlyappointed acting secretary of defense christopher miller on 11 november military experts consulted by the author thought the timeline impossible it would mean withdrawing not only us but also nato troops and contractors and the evacuation of embassy staff who would be left without military protection the military would also have to deal with their weaponry vehicles ammunition etc their ‘stuff’ in the words of military analyst jonathan schroden much of which with not enough time for an orderly removal would have to be destroyed to prevent it falling into enemy hands  ↑ 2	biden wrote this in foreign affairs about iran on nonproliferation and nuclear security the united states cannot be a credible voice while it is abandoning the deals it negotiated from iran to north korea russia to saudi arabia trump has made the prospect of nuclear proliferation a new nuclear arms race and even the use of nuclear weapons more likely as president i will renew our commitment to arms control for a new era the historic iran nuclear deal that the obamabiden administration negotiated blocked iran from getting a nuclear weapon yet trump rashly cast the deal aside prompting iran to restart its nuclear program and become more provocative raising the risk of another disastrous war in the region i’m under no illusions about the iranian regime which has engaged in destabilizing behavior across the middle east brutally cracked down on protesters at home and unjustly detained americans but there is a smart way to counter the threat that iran poses to our interests and a selfdefeating way—and trump has chosen the latter the recent killing of qasem soleimani the commander of iran’s quds force removed a dangerous actor but also raised the prospect of an everescalating cycle of violence in the region and it has prompted tehran to jettison the nuclear limits established under the nuclear deal tehran must return to strict compliance with the deal if it does so i would rejoin the agreement and use our renewed commitment

319,the following is a roundup of the key narratives from iran on the us election between 3 to 12 november with the us election called in favour of joe biden iranian media have been speculating even more than before about what the change in the us administration may mean for iran the mood overall is the same as it has been in the past several weeks with reformist outlets optimistic about the prospects of detente between washington and tehran while hardline outlets insist there is very little separating presidentelect biden and outgoing president donald trump hardline media did not only dismiss prospects of rapprochement but also questioned the legitimacy of the us presidential election owing to trumps unsubstantiated claims of fraud both reformist and hardline outlets however are unanimous in that bidens victory was a blow to the regional rivals of tehran including israel and saudi arabia  supporters of trumps maximum pressure policy against iran bidens election heralds change reformist journalist reza raisi argued in the proreform daily aftabe yazd that efforts by iranophobes around the world to ensure more sanctions imposed on tehran before trump leaves office show that bidens election lays the foundation for change he argued that they feel threatened by the changes that biden may bring to us policies the change that raisi refers to is what reformists in iran hope will lead to the cooling of tensions between tehran and washington which eventually result in the lifting of us sanctions in an oped for the proreform daily etemad ruhollah suri said biden will likely adopt a multidimensional outlook toward iran which he argued would deprive hardliners in the islamic republic of the opportunity to successfully promote their antinegotiation policy he also argued that failure to capitalise on bidens election could cost iran as washingtons allies may be more willing to get on board with whatever bidens iran policy might be the optimism coming from reformists is not shared by every member of the proreform camp journalist ahmad zeidabadi wrote on instagram that there was a possibility that those in iran who oppose any sort of interaction with the us maytake measures in the region especially in the persian gulf to put the us at odds with iran and neutralise any prospect of talks behind the scene crushing water in mortar hardline media have made no secret of their opposition to the prospect of talks with the us hossein shariatmadari the managing director of the hardline daily keyhan mocked the supporters of detente with america and compared their efforts to get iran and the us talking to crushing water in a mortar ie beating the air there will be no talks with america shariatmadari declared in his oped for keyhan before listing four conditions that could potentially pave the way for negotiations lifting of sanctions unfreezing irans assets abroad compensating iran for damages caused by the sanctions and retribution against trump for the killing of iranian general qasem soleimani shariatmadari said the only difference between trump and biden was that the former had ordered the assassination of soleimani conservative pundit mohammad hassan qadiri abiyaneh agreed telling fars news agency that when it comes to iran both democrats and republicans want poverty and misfortune to befall the iranian nation he argued that both trump and biden wanted a pushover government in iran and that is why they prefer to have reformists win in next years presidential election source bbc monitoring 12 nov 20 bbc mon me1 kshat,1
198,advanced search november 16 2020  protesters stage a sitin at seattle city hall june 3 2020 credit sounderbruce cc  ting ting cheng hello and welcome to everyone joining us today from across the globe our topic of discussion is protests in perspective civil disobedience  activism today my name is ting ting cheng and i am a civil rights attorney with legal momentum the womens legal defense and education fund where i engage in impact litigation policy advocacy and education to advance gender justice issues i am also an activist i was the legal director of the 2017 womens march on washington since then i have been engaged in a number of grassroots gender justice issues across the country it has been a long year a long month and an even longer week and we are undoubtedly living in a fraught and tumultuous time yet we have also seen an unprecedented groundswell of civic engagement and social activism providing movements of hope changing the public discourse around racial justice gender equality and immigrant rights among many other issues and it is extremely heartening to see the resilience of organizing as a political phenomenon and as an essential tool to building lasting political power we have also seen our movements in the united states grow from homegrown movements into widespread massmobilization efforts taking on a global nature some through the efforts of concerted planning like the womens marches and others quite spontaneous like the global protests in response to the murders of george floyd ahmaud arbery and breonna taylor among others in this discussion we will be discussing in depth both the current landscape and the antecedents to the current social movements we will be talking about successes and failures and the measures which we use to judge the efficacy of different movements we will look at the characteristics of their governance and who should or shouldnt be leading them we will also be assessing the nearterm and longterm tactics of social movements and the conflict between the two and i am sure various other topics that are going to come up i want to note that for students participating today some of you will perhaps be the leaders and drivers of these social movements for the coming decades so i encourage you to treat this like an open dialogue to submit your questions in the chat box at any time and we will focus on them after the speakers comments in the last 30 minutes now it is my pleasure to introduce our featured speakers our first speaker is dr deva woodly dr woodly is an associate professor of politics at the new school and the author of the politics of common sense how social movements use public discourse to change politics and win acceptance her research covers a variety of topics from media and communications to social movements race and imagination and political understandings of economics in each case she focuses on the impact of public discourse on the political understanding of social and economic issues as well as how those common understandings change democratic practice and public policy her process of inquiry moves from concrete realworld conditions to the conceptual implications of those realities in all cases she centers the perspective of ordinary citizens and political challengers with an eye toward how the demos impacts political action and shapes political possibilities welcome dr woodly our second featured speaker is dr erica chenoweth the berthold beitz professor in human rights and international affairs at harvard kennedy school and a susan s and kenneth l wallach professor at the radcliffe institute for advanced study dr chenoweth directs the nonviolent action lab at harvards carr center for human rights policy where they study political violence and its alternatives dr chenoweths forthcoming book civil resistance what everyone needs to know explores what civil resistance is how it works why it sometimes fails how violence and repression affect it and the longterm impacts of such resistance to start i would like to invite our speakers to offer initial thoughts about how we should understand the connection between protest and democracy and what the relationship is between resistance movements and successful progressive reform dr woodly i would like to ask you to lead this discussion deva woodly thank you so much ting i have so much to say about recent events of course i am sure that we all do the thing that i want to start out with is an overarching observation which is part of the argument that i make in my forthcoming book which is called reckoning black lives matter and the democratic necessity of social movements the main argument of this book is that we have been thinking about social movements in the wrong way in democratic theory and political science more generally that is to say that social movements are not interruptions in democracy but are instead the things that allow democracy to remain itself social movements are a feature and not a bug of democracy and they are actually a part of the regular functioning of democracy there is a reason why every moment in history when we have had democratic governance we have also had social movements and it is because as max weber said with his argument about the iron cage any kind of large institution over time will tend to serve itself as an institution rather than serve the mission for which it was built and that includes democratic institutions no matter how well designed the good thing is that in democracies what happens is that people believe the hype about democracy being a system of governance where it is actually the people governing themselves a system of selfgovernance so they can withdraw their authority—they are the authors of democratic governance—from their governors and demand to be responded to demand a reckoning in terms of how governance will be carried out that is the first thing social movements are necessary for democracy they are not incidental they are not interruptions they are not fugitive forms of democracy they are democracy itself i think that we see that happening in the us case but also around the world today when we enter periods like this period—and i think we have been in a period like this since the beginning of the 21st century what sidney tarrow calls a contentious cycle and that means there is a proliferation of social movements all around the world that overlap and interconnect in various kinds of ways—because at the end of the 20th century we had in most democracies a narrative about liberalism and development that we were at the end of history and that our welldesigned institutions would carry us forward indefinitely into the future in an upward spiral of increasing tolerance and prosperity well reality had something to say about that it actually has not been empirically the case that we have had increasing development in countries around the world and even in countries that are considered developed where soaring inequality has put much of the populations behind their expectations and we certainly have not had increasing tolerance around the world in any kind of uniform fashion this is something that we might have predicted american pragmatists like john dewey and others have always said—and there have been many thinkers who have made the point—that regression is just as likely as progression in any kind of political situation so we always have to keep our hands on the plow as it were that is what people have been learning in the 21st century that the arc of the moral universe actually does not bend toward justice unless we bend it the way that we do that is through political organizing participation and education and these things lead to increased political action and efficacy it is an efficacious and participating public that makes a democracy people get into—and people in the us case have gotten into—participating in politics in part because we had been suffering from what i call a politics of despair this politics of despair is not about a mood in terms of peoples affect toward politics at least not by itself it is actually a sense of decreasing trust in institutions decreasing trust in leadership observations that representation of the populace has become less and less frequent more unresponsive at least to large segments of the population and ends up in a belief that participating in politics does not make any difference this is a democratic despair which corresponds with but is not synonymous with a kind of affective despair we have been suffering from that at the beginning of the 21st century it lingers and has been going on and on but what combats that despair an antidote to that despair is social movements the thing that i want to say about the particular social movement that i focus on the movement for black lives is that they like other social movements specialize in this political phenomenon called organizing organizing is another phenomenon that has gotten short shrift in political science we usually talk about mobilization which is telling people who already have the requisite knowledge and skills to show up and do something or we talk about activism and activism means that you turn up in the streets outside regular institutions to demonstrate your dissatisfaction with or advocacy for some cause but activism is a relatively shortterm process its a punctuated kind of action you show up in the streets for that afternoon or even for that series of days but you are not necessarily engaging in a process of analysis education and longterm collective work organizing is different from either mobilization or activism although it can be coextensive with those for many people political organizing is important because it takes place over time and its constituent parts are meeting engagement education analysis collective identity and action this process of organizing i argue is a mechanism by which you increase peoples political efficacy we talk about the ways that efficacy matters political efficacy matters and its absence can lead to negative effects for democracies but political organizing is one of the few things that actually increases peoples political efficacy sometimes we talk about this in bland terms as participation we know that political participation and political education can increase political efficacy but the way that this education and participation come together is through political organizing i should say that large demonstrations can be a part of organizing getting people out into the street as activists can be a gateway to political organizing and we saw that in the us case over the summer when at least 26 million americans poured out into the street in defense of black lives we dont have any kind of definitive studies yet but so far it seems as though those instances were a major source of mobilization—voter registration voter education etc—in the united states that those huge protests helped the democrats win national victory this election year on a smaller scale we see the way that political organizing has changed politics changed the composition of the electorate and changed the items on the political agendas that we talk about in georgia and arizona respectively for example in the state of georgia which for the first time in many years voted for a democratic candidate for president—it went for biden for president—we see that leaders there black women leaders there mostly particularly obviously stacey abrams but also latosha brown of black voters matter and nsé ufot of the new georgia project had a multiyear plan of meeting engaging with educating and serving people who had been previously disengaged from the political process this kind of political organizing has huge payoffs but they take a long time its over time and we see a similar process having gone on in arizona and new mexico among indigenous organizers if you look at the voting returns in those states it seems as though indigenous voters did a lot to flip for example arizona blue and there are organizations like the tribal organizing campaign that serve as an umbrella group in those areas to make sure that people in the hopi and navajo nations among others were educated about the election and were able to turn out but its not just electoral politics that are the object of organizing this kind of organizing that folks in georgia arizona in the midwest and all over the united states have been doing is about meeting people where they are with local concerns the other major point about political organizing is that it is an inductive form of doing politics when i say inductive what i mean is that it goes from the particular to the general it starts local—what are the things that are problems for you in this moment what are the things that we can talk about collectively solving in your neighborhood in your county in your municipality and in your state—and then it builds from that kind of political engagement to engagement on larger regional national and even sometimes transnational levels this is a different approach than we have had in a lot of campaignbased democratic politics in which you ring people up a few weeks before the election and try to mobilize them—without engaging them—on a national platform without engaging them about how that might relate to their local everyday concerns for me the story of 2020 in the united states is a story about political organizing and a story about how democracy recalls itself and how democratic citizens are actually made because thats the thing about political organizing its not just teaching people to do a thing organizing can affect peoples political subjectivity so it is not just that folks are mobilized to vote or mobilized to show up at an action but they start to think about themselves through the longterm process of organizing as the kind of people who can act that is important because it creates a fund of democratic knowledge engagement and activity that can and will be applied in more than one area in more than one instance i think that is the story that we should keep our eye on going forward ting ting cheng so many topics we can dig deeper into but right now we will turn it over to dr chenoweth for her comments erica chenoweth thank you so much and thanks to professor woodly for that excellent intro and i hope a sneak peek into your book reckoning which i hope is available for preorder because thats what ill be doing right after this call thanks so much to the organizers and for those who are participating today what i wanted to do is just talk briefly a little bit about some of the patterns that we have been seeing worldwide in the relationship between what may be indeed a third wave of autocratization which we are seeing around the world right now the way that ordinary people worldwide have been fighting back what we should make of those attempts to push back defend and expand democracy and how we should make sense of that in light of what was just shared as well about the 2020 election in the united states first what has happened in the united states in the past four years and in particular in the last year is recordbreaking in terms of the united states own history of collective action we have seen more mass mobilizations and mass demonstrations in the united states than in any other period of recorded history in the united states as professor woodly was saying last summers uprising or rebellion for black lives was definitely the largest and broadest mobilization we have seen in the united states it exceeded any other period in terms of the breadth geographic scope and numerical power that was on display between the end of may of 2020 and the end of july of 2020 and the united states is not alone in terms of episodes of mass mobilization being record breaking in the past decade in fact worldwide we have seen more mass mobilizations demanding democracy around the world than in any other period at least in the last hundred years part of the reason why we may be seeing this is in fact because people are expressing an urgent concern about the state of democracy around the world that is to say countries have been experiencing both within established democracies regressions toward autocracy or expansions of autocracy within some democracies as may be the case in the united states in other countries that were transitioning toward democracy we have started to see them backslide significantly all around the world scholars of comparative politics over the past 15 years have been raising alarm bells about the fragile state of the democratic nature of global governance with regard to these key states tipping back over if we think about places like turkey poland hungary india the united states brazil and many many of the different countries around the world that many people pointed to as hopeful beacons of progress and governments responsiveness to their own citizens are now considered cautionary tales and indeed places where as i mentioned people have been trying to rise up and fight back with varying levels of success another issue that is important to our time is the rise of digital authoritarianism the reason this is important for movements is because in the past one of the ways that social movements and mass mobilizations have been able to dramatize their claims and create that sense of urgency and unity has been exactly because their governments in cracking down on them have made major missteps and in doing so the movements were able to shore up more popular support and demonstrate the legitimacy of their claims for example bruteforce crackdowns against unarmed demonstrators in places like east germany or poland were used in fact to express more clearly the demands of the population that the government had overstepped its rights and authorities and that the people had a real claim to justice the difference now is that many different authoritarian regimes are much more savvy and capable in the way that they suppress popular dissent they exploit digital platforms for much more focused surveillance focused forms of repression that are much more selective and so dont alienate all of their supporters they also use these digital platforms to mobilize their own counterprotesters and countermobilizations which makes it look like they too share popular claims of legitimacy indeed they are able to use digital platforms to locate and arrest harass or terrorize particular people that they find as increasingly important within the movements so even though there have been regimes in which there was a great deal of control over the information environment in which movements have been operating in the past the scope and scale of the challenges that movements face in maintaining control over the information environment in which they operate is perhaps unparalleled today i will move forward into the question of how do we know when these mass mobilizations are having a good chance of success or are likely to succeed charles tilly used to put forward a fourpronged criteria which you can remember because its a funny acronym wunc—worthiness unity numbers and commitment what he argued was basically that movements that were able to score well on all four of those criteria were much more likely to be enduring and much more likely to genuinely change the balance of power in a society my own criterion is fourfold as well although its not totally unrelated to tillys the first is definitely numbers if we look at the 627 mass mobilizations that have occurred around the world from 1900 to 2019—that is movements with at least a thousand people calling for the overthrow of a regime prodemocracy territorial independence or liberation—those that had the highest numbers of people participating in peak moments were definitely the most likely to achieve success part of the reason is that very large numbers are often correlated with a high degree of diversity that is the movements also are able to elicit the participation of people cutting across a huge range of locations in the society social status and political and economic positions what does that do for the movement it gives it really important social power which can translate into political leverage at key moments and in some cases economic coercion and economic leverage so very large numbers with diverse participants make the movement more likely to create the second important factor which is defections from the opponent for example in south africa one of the most important factors that led to the fall of the legal apartheid regime was the fact that blackled boycotts of whiteowned businesses—massive organizing that took place in the townships that then blockaded the economic potential of whiteowned businesses—essentially created this international momentum that so isolated south africa from the rest of the global economy that reformists within the ruling party put direct pressure on party leaders to start to negotiate with and remove the ban on the african national congress and everything it was basically that people power that began to create shifts within the pillars of support that were propping up apartheid in this case economic pillars in other contexts for example in serbia when there was movement to overthrow slobodan milošević in 2000 and initiate a democratic transition there the key pillar that was propping up milošević was not really economic elites it was the security forces so the movement expanded its numbers and its social power to the extent that when hundreds of thousands of people descended on belgrade to demand that slobodan milošević leave office after he stole elections there were people within the security forces who recognized their own children in the crowd here you can see the effects of that social power on initiating a key moment in the minds of security forces that they actually dont want to go along with repressing the event and firing on the demonstrators with live fire but rather they will just pretend they didnt hear the order security forces pretending they dont hear the order is defection and that is enough to win the day for many movements so we have large numbers that are very representative of the population we have the creation of defections within key pillars of the opponents support base those pillars can be security forces economic elites civil servants people within the inner entourage say the trump campaigns lawyers and things like that who are critical to holding out power when people are calling for change the third thing that successful movements do is they innovate new tactics this is very important because movements that tend to overrely on a single technique like protests like demonstrating every friday something that becomes very routinized end up succumbing much more quickly first of all to protester fatigue but the second thing is they often subject their participants to a higher risk of repression or communal violence from opponents so movements that are capable of having the capacity to shift to methods of dispersion like stayathomes or strikes or forms of economic noncooperation tend to be much more effective because they have the capability of maneuver when the state begins to ramp up violence against them the fourth important thing that successful movements do is they maintain discipline even when repression does begin to escalate what does this look like it largely looks like they maintain fidelity to their own plan that they dont get thrown off course but they actually expect and anticipate repression and then find a way to politically exploit it to their benefit not welcoming it nobody is trying to get repressed but if it happens they try to document it and use it to create what gene sharp called political jiujitsu basically making the opponent look weak unjust and barbaric and therefore amplify the claims of the movement the second thing that is required in discipline is narrative discipline which is to say not being thrown offcourse and distracted by counternarratives that are coming in to attack the movement instead the movement sticks to its own narrative and keeps the focus on the core claim and the justification for the core claim those are the four things—numbers defections tactical innovations and discipline what do we need for those things to happen we need to organize i think one of the key reasons why many movements have struggled around the world including in the united states before now is that there has been an overemphasis on mobilizing and less of an emphasis on organizing because to have the capacity to do these things skillfully means that there has to be a baseline level of trust political education collective identity and also a sense that the struggle is longer than just the next event we have to plan to be in the streets that the struggle is a long struggle and even if there is one particular event that gets derailed we are still in this and its a longterm kind of struggle movements that end up planning event to event or march to march or protest to protest are in much more danger of being thrown offcourse and having these sort of demobilizational factors affect their longterm trajectories the final thing i will say is that i agree with professor woodly that there is nothing inevitable about democracy in fact if we look at the history of the world democracy is the least common form of governance it has had many different experiments over the millennia and we are in the latest one there is nothing inevitable about it lasting and there is certainly nothing inevitable about it happening in the future we need look no further than cases like poland where in the 1990s it was held up as a beacon of how people power and solidarity and labor organizing could provide major democratic breakthroughs against the odds in fact after solidarity came to power after the first democratic elections in that country civil society remained rebellious and held solidarity to account for the failures of a number of the different policies that it claimed it would put in place that was 25 30 years ago today poland is one of the cases that people cite as a cautionary tale a place where democratic backsliding has taken place and a major autocratic breakthrough has come to pass there is a farright party in power that party has assaulted judicial independence it has passed incredibly harsh laws against lgbtq people and has recently passed laws that roll back reproductive rights in major ways today nobody would hold up poland as a beacon of democratic progress even in such a case we can see how backsliding is part of the story here i would point again to the promise of the way that organizing linked with mobilizational capacity can provide us ways to prevent democracy from collapsing altogether in their study of 76 countries in which democratic backsliding had taken place the political scientists robert kauffman and stephan haggard argued that basically once institutions are corrupted and once norms have been shattered there is nothing that saves democratic systems except for a mobilized civil society if civil society is mobilized we can pull ourselves back from the brink but if not basically in every single case autocracies or dictatorships consolidated their power so nobody is going to save us it is up to us and the way that we structure our civil society in relationship to one another with capacities for organization and capacities for mass mobilization to protect democracy when necessary are both part of that story ting ting cheng thank you those are such rich and important comments i wanted to follow up with you guys about this idea of timing and pace dr woodly talked about how lasting change through mobilization and organizing through social movements can take generations and centuries even it is not the result of one action or one event but at the same time we have seen with this pandemic covid19 is like an accelerator people in the beginning thought it was going to be the great equalizer and it hasnt been it is a revealer it is something that completely reveals deep and historic and systemic inequalities and that seems to be something that has connected all of us globally this kind of global outrage to statesanctioned violence and to inequality in the medical system so its not just a medical crisis its something much deeper than that and it has really bound us together and seemed to have accelerated and propelled these social movements forward i suppose a related thing that is always on my mind is the tools of changing technologies and the rise of social media and how that impacts social movements are these game changers do they provide a new set of tools for organizing in the future or are we still talking about the same tactics and strategies that movements have always employed what are the opportunities of this kind of acceleration moving forward with the future of social movements why dont we start with you erica erica chenoweth sure a couple of things about digital media i think about 15 years ago it would be easier to argue that social media and digital platforms more generally were giving the edge to activists because when the technology was coming through it seemed like it was creating kind of an alternate public sphere where people could communicate and organize in ways that werent available to them in closed systems particularly in authoritarian regimes there were some real tactical and strategic benefits of these technologies being available today i think basically it is the reverse i think the technologies have created many many challenges not just because of what i mentioned about surveillance and the ability to countermobilize protesters who are in favor of the incumbent but i also think the nature of the information environment now is so segmented that there is a real risk if people overrely on the information that they get from social media and their own selfselected information silos that they in fact are overconfident about how many people agree with them and so when they go into a political contest they dont have good information about how committed the opposition is and vice versa it does complicate the nature of the information landscape and how that can be used to inform strategy and organizing i think it is true that many of the changes that we see are longterm and that many of the different breakthroughs that we saw this year in the united states have come after decades or generations of organizing and mass mobilization capacity in the united states against authoritarianism in various different forms so to some extent the united states has only really been a democracy since 1965 if that if only legally and not in the quality of democracy as people like vesla weaver and robert mickey have pointed out with enclaves of authoritarianism we havent even had the full breakthrough yet in this country and the degree to which social media can solve that problem i think is just a much longer term struggle that is underway deva woodly i would say that although political organizing and its payoffs can take generations in terms of particular protest cycles or agendasetting change the scope of time is a little bit shorter i think we are talking in terms of years and perhaps a decade for particular outcomes to happen rather than across generations to achieve democracy in its largest sense is certainly a multigenerational process that may never resolve which is okay because thats what politics is politics is an iterative process but i would say that there are definitely distinct outcomes that we can see over the course of a period of years and certainly by the end of a decade like a 10year period where you can measure empirically the difference that political organizing has made that is one thing that i would say people go in with plans they go in with a plan like how long might it take us to do this thing stacey abrams went to the democratic national committee 10 years ago with her plan for how to flip georgia blue and it was a 10year plan we do see moments where we can measure outcomes in a scope of time that is shorter than a generation but still thats a multiyear process that is not like every two years or every four years thats the time scale i think that were thinking about i really loved dr chenoweths comment—and i really want the citation for that study—about organized civil society and how it takes us back from the brink because i think that is something that todays organizers and activists have come to understand in the movement for black lives for example colloquially there is a saying were all weve got that means that they operate with the understanding that an organized civil society is the only thing that is going to help people to achieve their goals but also just basically keep people safe and preserve peoples lives the institutions are not going to do that on their own we already know empirically that the institutions are not serving that function for the entire population and indeed are counterproductive in a lot of instances for black and brown folks in the us case and with minorities all over the world in different global contexts i would say that movements operating today understand that the process of political education that they are facilitating that they are catalyzing is one that is going to have victories in their lifetime and they are willing to celebrate those victories with the understanding though that the work is long that the process of getting free is one that is ongoing and i think it is because they have a notion of freedom that is closer to what neil roberts calls freedom as marronage which is to say that there is not a binary—freedom and unfreedom instead what we have is a process of getting free and that process is ongoing because things always change exogenous factors material factors peoples attitudes and peoples needs all change we have to be in the habit of getting free in order to keep ourselves safe and to meet our goals over time about social media i definitely agree with erica that it has pluses and minuses and is definitely not a cureall for anything but i should say that activists and organizers operating today in the movement for black lives have learned how to use social media to its best good as far as they can and that is basically as a forum not only for mobilization but for political education there is so much political education that goes on online from social movements and it is a way for them to exercise that narrative discipline that dr chenoweth was talking about that is necessary for successful movements this movement has done that while maintaining contentious positions and insisting on those positions and educating the populace about why those positions are worth supporting why theyre worthy we can see this in the debate about black lives matter blm versus all lives matter which took place in 2015 we can even see this ongoing right now in the debate about the slogan defund the police ill betcha how thats going to turn out this is because they have such narrative discipline and are able to control their message online and also engage in backandforth engage in dialogue so there is a deliberative democracy that does take place online of course that is not all that takes place online there are a lot of other things—surveillance harassment violence and all of these downsides—but i should say that the movement is very aware of the tool that online organizing can be when combined with facetoface organizing community building convenings etc ting ting cheng thank you for that deva i have always had a question about the governance of social movements and the profound spontaneous nature of the protests this summer for the movement for black lives can you talk a little bit about the lack of centralized leadership within the movement what are the things that spur the movement forward or hold it back in that way of governance deva woodly sure the leadership question is one of my favorite ones the idea that we have protests particularly enormous ones like we saw this summer being spontaneous is wrong which is not to say that people did not pour into the streets spontaneously in minneapolis on may 26 the day after george floyd was murdered and the video of his murder by a police officer went viral people did pour into the streets spontaneously but in order to maintain and increase that level of engagement required organizing and mobilization what you had was a movement apparatus that had experience with mass mobilization from uprisings all over the country since 2014 but especially from the ferguson uprising that took place they understood how to increase the number of demonstrations and protests that were going on to support the organizations and people who were already in the streets and also to spread the methodology of how to create a protest in your town it is estimated that 40 percent of american counties that is municipalities had protests in defense of black lives and that is blue counties and red counties something like 8 percent of people according to new york times data claim to have participated in a blm protest over this summer that did not happen spontaneously that happened with a lot of support there were a lot of toolkits shared online—how do you do a protest in your own area how do you keep people safe how do you make sure that people are masked how do you make sure that people have access to water how do you make sure that there are medics on hand in case people are teargassed or sprayed it requires an enormous amount of coordination the question of how do you do that coordination if you dont have centralized leadership is that the movement for black lives has a semifederated kind of leadership which means that the title movement for black lives is a name for an umbrella organization that includes dozens and dozens of autonomous local groups that run their own show where they are they have their own campaigns their own interests you have southerners on new ground which is an lgbtq multiracial organization that operates in the southern region you have dream defenders which is based on college campuses in florida you have byp100 which is a black youth organization based in chicago you have black lives matter global network which is over in oakland you have all of these completely autonomous organizations that work on their own stuff in their own area but they come together at topically organized tables under the rubric of the movement for black lives you have a media and communications table an organizing table and a policy table representatives from these organizations come together in tables under the rubric of movement for black lives and then they coordinate activity based on expertise and they decide when they are going to have national campaigns they decide how to distribute resources for large actions etc the movement takes a federated approach so it gets the kind of coordinating capacity that you get from a large organization while not getting the detriments of a large organization which is stagnation being slow to act and having people at the top of the organization who can be decapitated—i think that is the term of art in the international relations literature—basically taken out coopted arrested etc whereas the movement has this idea which is an idea that in political theory we can think comes from deleuze which is that they want to be a network they want to be like ginger in the ground you can cut it off anywhere and then plant it anywhere and it will sprout back up there are movement philosophers who talk about this in different ways for example adrienne maree brown talks about emergent strategy and it is all about this that you want to create a movement—and this has deep roots in black feminist thought by the way this is ella baker also from the american civil rights movement—that can be plopped down anywhere and do the work that needs to be done that is what i would say this movement is very highly adaptive and is very attentive to the history of movements so it is no mistake that they have this form they are studied and are very interested in how you have the coordinating capacity of a large organization without being stultified the way that a large organization can become erica chenoweth i will add just a little bit to that i think all of that is exactly right i just want to point out one other quick detail in research that i have done with jeremy pressman and kanisha bond and jenna arnold the mass mobilization that was the largest in terms of locations before this past summer was in april of 2018 a month after the shooting at parkland high school in florida when over 4400 schools experienced walkouts over the lack of gun controls 4400 separate locations around the united states that is by far the most largescale simultaneous singleday demonstration in terms of numerical locations there were 12 home schools in the database of people who walked out on their parents there were 150 kindergartens there were elementary schools there were middles schools high schools and colleges and universities that participated in this what does that mean that means that two years ago youth led and organized an uprising and demanded that adults begin to implement major change around gun control who were the youth they were the most diverse cohort of youth that this country has ever seen much of the organizing was done by black and brown and indigenous youth in collaboration with one another and what we saw this summer at least in the state of pennsylvania is that school districts in which there had been youthled march for our lives uprisings in 2018 were much more likely to have also organized a movement for black lives or black lives mattersassociated racial justice protest this past summer what did they do in between they learned how to organize deva woodly thats right erica chenoweth i think that this is powerful in showing the trajectory of learning innovation communication and engagement and youth groups now are on the leading edge of these organizing and mobilization efforts deva woodly absolutely i should say there is direct collaboration between youth groups and the movement for black lives which is also a lot of youth dream defenders march for our lives sunrise movement—there is a lot of overlap there so a lot of knowledge is shared between all of these movements ting ting cheng yes and similarly the overlap is there too with the womens movement and the youth movement as well— deva woodly and the womens march ting ting cheng —with march on and with the future coalition i feel like we should talk about the election very quickly before we open it up for the qa section this question has to do with the kind of tension between shortterm and longterm organizing goals and strategies biden and harris prevailed in the election and yet the democrats lost seats in congress where they were expected to gain them now we have centrist democrats blaming the partys progressive members and also these progressive ideas that they support like the movement to defund the police for these losses can you two discuss the tension that exists there on the one hand of having important visible effective progressive allies in the government now who are directly aligned with these movements more so than ever before in talking about universal equality yet at the same time having these concepts being blamed for the failure of the democratic party to fully consolidate power at this very important moment where it would influence the degree to which joe biden can have a truly progressive agenda in the next four years during his presidency can you guys go into that a little bit the tension that exists right now within the democratic party deva woodly my answer to that would be that people in the streets ordinary citizens are not the only ones who require democratic education i would say that it is less a question of ideology than it is philosophy of how you conduct democracy in the postmortems of the election by folks who were actually running for national legislative seats like doug jones who lost his seat in alabama and like beto orourke who was not running for office but was coordinating campaigns in texas and by alexandria ocasiocortez who won her seat what you see is a combination—each one of them has put out statements for why they think democrats lost seats and they are across the ideological spectrum in the democratic party and each one has noticed some commonalities the commonalities that they noticed are where people were organizing they won their seats and where they werent they didnt regardless of ideology that is the empirical fact so far and when i say organizing i mean in places where activists continued to knock on doors when the democratic party stopped knocking on doors because of the pandemic where there were organizations outside the party that were registering voters where demonstrations took place and where people were being politically engaged around issues broader than the election the folks in those places won their seats and the folks in places where that didnt happen lost their seats i think that is the lesson more than any other kind of ideological lesson beyond that in terms of the vilification of slogans like defund the police again i would turn to empirics it is true that the slogan defund the police does not poll at a majority level of popularity but in terms of social movements it polls around the level of 38 to 40 percent support which is pretty high for social movements we should remember that in the mid20th century the civil rights movement at the peak of its power was only polling at about 33 or 36 percent approval that is the other thing that social movements are pushing the discourse forward they are not campaigns they are not interested in polltested things they are interested in actually moving what people call the overton window that is the list of subjects that we talk about as politically possible desirable and necessary and this movement is doing that besides the phrase defund that slogan not being popular with the majority of the electorate the things that defund the police actually means which is reallocating funds from policing to mental health services and social support services are very popular and it is only because of the discourse of defund that we are even having a conversation about those other things and at least 11 municipalities around the country have already started defunding processes but they are not all going apace some of them have started them and then been blocked for example in minneapolis but they have started those processes and others are doing a lot of experiments in terms of when people call 911 for nonviolent things perhaps we should send in an emergency medical technician and a social worker instead of an armed policeman those kinds of pilot programs have been started in municipalities all over the country as well all of that is wins for movement but also wins for people for individuals around the country who are now being served in a different way and it also has expanded our thinking about what safety is and what safety means and that matters erica chenoweth my first reaction to your question was that i do want to push back a little bit on the idea that the election was a downer for the democratic party first of all there was recordshattering turnout at least for the past hundred years the margin of victory is larger than all but three other presidents that have ever been elected in terms of popular vote for joe biden the electoral college vote is now totally decisive he is ontrack to flip numerous states and congressional districts by the way the ticket included the firstever black woman vice president the population elected a black woman to the white house six years ago people were saying one of the major downsides for hillary was that she was a woman and that sexism was literally the only thing that could never be shattered in this country and that has changed this year it was the first ever presidential victory address that was transinclusive in terms of its language and we are up for what could potentially be the most diverse cabinet and principal political appointee process that we have ever seen so i think this needs to be celebrated before being critiqued just on those terms it is not an unfamiliar problem that movements always have to navigate the insideoutside game this is just part of the nature that politics emerges from cycles in which there has been collaboration for the purposes of electoral mobilization and then there is something of a fragmentation that comes where people have to reposition themselves some choose to go and belong to the inside game and some remain on the outside game and then it is a creative process of trying to hold political leaders and public officials to account i think one of the things that is important about this is recognizing that elections can sometimes suppress mobilization because there is so much energy that goes into the election itself and then people need a break and they want to rest the thing is that social movements are always operating in what is called the political opportunity structure that is the institutions and the political winds in which they have to operate elections are basically the only time when movements can significantly have an impact on what their political opportunity structure is going to look like in the next few years in this instance from the movements perspective the main goal is to favorably set up an opportunity structure that will allow the movement to have more influence on the inside game than it did before i would say that they have done that does that mean they are going to get everything that they want no but they definitely have a much more favorable kind of political opportunity environment in which they will now be operating with a lot more promise for making serious gains the one other cautionary that many people have said a lot is about the fact that there was also very high voter turnout and enthusiasm for trump voters i would say that one of the most important things to keep an eye out on is countermobilization and that that is going to be part of our country going forward and the degree to which movements navigate and negotiate the fact that some of the primary protesters in this country right now might be against biden for other reasons than progressive movements might be against him is actually a major struggle and a challenge and has to be thought through strategically for those who want to pressure him but without completely undermining his position visàvis a much more fierce opposition on the right ting ting cheng thank you for the pragmatism and the cautionary tale i want to note that it is past the hour so i will be turning things over to alex woodson from carnegie council who will be managing the qa chat box alex woodson thanks ting ting the first question is from billy the question is there is a portion of the american population that believes the 2020 protests for black lives were solely dangerous riots can you discuss the role that the media plays in framing protests as riots and how we can overcome this mischaracterization erica chenoweth i can speak to this we know there is a very well documented set of media biases in general the first is an urban bias the second is an official bias and the third is a violence bias the urban bias is that media tend to report more on what goes on in cities than on what goes on in suburbs or outside of cities the second is official bias which means that journalists tend to call up their local police department or city official to ask for a spokesperson to make a comment before they go out and talk to ordinary people who were there to get their official take on what happened the third thing is that there is a violence bias which means that any time there is word of something becoming tense or clashes that they tend to overreport and overrepresent those events relative to what else is going on the other thing is that that is overlaid with other ways of framing and depicting people who are protesting as transgressive and criminal and there is a sort of modal reaction that they were troublemakers and that if they were not troublemakers nothing would have gone wrong the blame attribution is often on people who are protesting rather than on agents of the state who are the most common sources of violence one thing i will say too about this is that the way that media often depict clashes that may happen is that they tend to depict them in an ambiguous light they will say police and protesters clash when actually it was police beating protesters or they will say violent protests break out when in fact there was no violence by protesters there was violence by police or counterprotesters or there might have been some vandalism that then gets caught up in the headline as violence which most people who study these things agree is not violence the way that media frame these events does often have an effect on public opinion of these events so when you have media reporting in ambiguous terms or without responsible techniques of validating information then you can get a situation in which movements are falsely depicted as violent riots in research that jeremy pressman and i did on all of the episodes of the movement for black lives this past summer and other affiliated racial justice protests we found that 977 percent of the events took place without any property destruction or any violence by protestors the violence that did take place was almost always initiated by police or by counterprotesters and we can see that in the video representations of it that have been collected by many different people if you think about that and you think about as professor woodly said we are talking about 8 percent of the us population having participated in this movement that is probably 25 or 26 million people in this country having participated in this movement and you can then look at the fact that there was such a tiny tiny shred of any kind of incident that could warrant criminal charges by anybody affiliated with or participating in the movement is a truly staggering achievement particularly given what this movement was up against that they were able to maintain such strict discipline deva woodly yes i want to underscore everything dr chenoweth said but also say that its actually a relatively small proportion of people who believe that the demonstrations this summer were riots that narrative is one that has never reached majority support most people understand perhaps because so many people participated themselves or knew people who had participated that violence was not a predominant factor or even a very frequent factor in protests this summer that is partly a red herring i think that is a worry that we have from the past that is not one that is predominant today among most people now partisans who are predisposed to have a negative opinion about the protests in the first place may say that these protests were mostly riots but most people dont believe that according to public opinion polling i think that the movement has done an extremely good job mostly through its regular political education communication and reach in terms of the diversity of people who are participating—something that professor chenoweth has also talked about—to neutralize that narrative as much as they can so far going forward we will have to see what happens also according to preliminary exit polls the whole framing of law and order that was supposed to be against these riots fell completely flat even among republicans it was not their top issue so i think we should worry less about that and worry more about pushing progressive agendas forward alex woodson we will go to bard colleges jonathan becker for the next question you have spoken about movements in different countries and deva about the movement for black lives but how about transnational movements and the linking of movements how do we see the movement for black lives as a global movement how about the resistance to rising authoritarianism in poland hungary and the united states cooperate and learn and unite deva woodly for my part the movement for black lives is a global movement protests in defense of black lives took place in more than 60 countries and on every continent except antarctica so it is a transnational movement already it was conceived that way on purpose from 2015 one of the first things that the movement for black lives did once it became the movement for black lives was to send delegations to different parts of the world to figure out what people were considered black a global color line how they were organizing what their issues were where the overlaps were and what the differences were so delegations were sent to south africa brazil australia and palestine to get an idea of how this movement could be transnational how perhaps this kind of communication and sharing of tactics strategies innovations and information toolkits—toolkits are huge in the movement—could happen thats what i would say in terms of prodemocracy struggles that are not necessarily related and how could they make connections im not sure perhaps dr chenoweth will have more to say about how folks in hungary and poland and turkey what kind of connections could be made there erica chenoweth thank you for the question the only thing that i would add to what professor woodly has said so well is just that there are many movements now who have taken inspiration from the movement for black lives with regard to police brutality and the claims the population can make expressly about defunding or abolishing abusive police forces notably one right now that is ongoing in nigeria is the end sars movement which is explicitly seeing itself in solidarity with the movement for black lives and movements against the abuse of power by repressive agents of the state that is linked i think to this second part of the question about movements that are fighting against authoritarianism one of the patterns that is quite notable is that movements that start out for example calling for economic reforms or to protest a particular policy change like the removal of a food subsidy or something like that often escalate into movements demanding the overthrow of the government or regime change or democracy when those initial protests are met with police brutality most of the movements that we are seeing all around the world today whether they are in hong kong india the united states belarus and nigeria wherever we find them one of the core claims is that they want justice for police brutality i think that is one of the most commonly shared concerns around the world today perhaps because of the nature of the militarization of police forces worldwide and the fact that militarized police forces seem themselves to be in solidarity with one another so they are learning from one another they are training together and people around the world have now taken it upon themselves to begin to question and push back on that seeing these as civil servants public servants and not as repressive agents of the state that need to be held accountable as well in terms of ways that these movements can connect and learn from one another this is one of the biggest questions that is out there there is a very well documented global right wing for example evangelical groups far right groups and even ordinary conservative groups have invested a lot into developing transnational agendasetting power and the ability to organize communities all over the world to push for more conservative policies and public narratives and norms why the left has not been able to establish and sustain a similar transnational solidarity network in the past 30 years is a big open question in the meantime there are some interesting developments around the expansion of groups of activists who are willing to train other activists from similar settings there are groups like the center for applied nonviolent action and strategies like nonviolence international like the international center on nonviolent conflict rise resist inspire speak empower even some groups affiliated with unarmed peacekeeping teams like nonviolent peaceforce or the christian peacemaker teams and peace brigades international and things like this are willing to offer trainings to people based on their own learnings from their own contexts about how to fight back against authoritarianism but these movements and groups do not have a ton of resources behind them not anywhere near the scale of what the global right wing has been able to invest in its transnational work so i think that is going to be a major challenge where do you even convene these people how do you start how do you support their work how do you make sure that they are connected with those who have the skill sets and knowhow that they need deva woodly i will say that i do think people are thinking through those questions right now that it has become clear that that is something that is necessary going forward because so many of these problems are common globally but i should also say that in the case of the right wing they have invested a ton of resources in creating this international infrastructure but that is also in part because religious institutions which were not always considered right wing were ceded to the right wing ideologically in the middle of the last century so there was already a ready network of institutions in which to organize people and that you could pour resources into there are religious left movements but unless they are able to funnel resources to those institutions they are going to have to create their own institutions that are not preexisting and thats a pretty heavy lift although it is one that people are seeking to undertake alex woodson i think i will ask two questions together and then we can wrap up if that works for everyone these questions are somewhat related the first is from carnegie councils grady jacobsen dr woodly spoke about the advantage of a federalized movement like the movement for black lives but how do social movements deal with the potential for splintering of their group or message if there are disagreements about organizing strategy and tactics the divergence between the approaches of martin luther king jr and malcolm x and other black leaders during the civil rights movement comes to mind as a possible example teresa geidel asks as for the disciplined narrative of movements apart from disregarding counternarratives what do you think about getting sidetracked as a movement by wanting to include more and more issues that align with the movements values but are not the initial narrower focus deva woodly in terms of splintering again remember that the movement for black lives is a very studious movement and there are people who are living who participated in the movements of the 1960s they have learned lots of things from previous black liberation movements but also feminist queer and disability movements about the dangers of splintering that is part of the reason they have the structure they have that it is federated so that people can maintain autonomous space instead of centralized the other thing is that the movement for black lives is also an abolitionist movement which means that central to relating interpersonally in organizations but also between organizations and hopefully in society is a politics of care and that means that they are interested in mediation in seeking justice that is restorative rather than about retribution and that means including inside their own organization inside most organizations of the movement for black lives you have officers or committees or councils on healing justice which are responsible for resolving disputes both within those organizations and between organizations in the movement so you have a strong culture of mediation and restoration rather than retribution and exile although some people are removed from the communities i dont mean that all of this functions completely seamlessly but i do mean that people in movement are very aware of the fact that interpersonal splintering or a disagreement on tactics can destroy movement organizations it is not something that they dont know they work very hard to prevent that and so far have been very successful that is also partly because they are united in terms of some very basic beliefs in the empirical world which keeps giving us instances of black people being murdered by police and vigilantes thats one thing let me give you a quick anecdote from the movement in 2015 there was a convening and out of this convening would come the birth of the actual organization movement for black lives this was the spring after the ferguson uprising all kinds of organizations and individuals came there you had a broad diverse swath of activists from the christian tradition religious activists queer activists people who were interested in immigration black maternal mortality all kinds of activists came together this convening was about—and this was their slogan—turning this moment into a movement so they were trying to develop a way to get together to coordinate activity what kind of organization they would have but it was a pretty contentious process people had a lot of disagreements about strategy tactics focus and leadership and the organizers of this were a little bit afraid that nothing good was going to come out of it this was in cleveland ohio by the way then on the last day of the event when people were leaving to go back to their home institutions and it was somewhat ambiguous what was going to come out of the event the police detained a 14yearold black boy on the street right in the neighborhood where the convening was happening they said that they were detaining him because he was drinking in public the boy said that he had not been drinking in public and did not know why he was being detained all of these different factions—the church ladies the queer folks the healers the trans folks—who had just been fighting banded together to unarrest this little boy and get him back to his mother and they did this successfully they were able to surround the child and get information about how to contact his mother the police lied to them and said that they were arresting this boy on the request of his parent which they absolutely were not this was a moment that united them and this is the moment that keeps happening again and again and again no matter what kind of differences they may have in terms of use of tactics or strategy going forward they are united in defense of black lives and the world keeps making it immediately necessary to be united and coordinated in our activities to do this that immediacy of the problem and that experience of triumph that does happen from time to time combined with the commitment to restorative justice prevents the kind of scorchedearth fights that have characterized movements in the past erica chenoweth one of the things the question about having a range of goals and whether that undermines the movements primary message and effectiveness reminded me of is an article by mary elizabeth king who was one of the field secretaries for the student nonviolent coordinating committee during the national campaigns in the 1950s and 1960 she was responding to critiques about the occupy movement at the time having been too abstract and having advanced too many different claims and demands and it being disorganized and having different claims coming from different cities and the like she was saying that one of the common misconceptions when we look retrospectively at movements like the civil rights movement for example is that they had agreement about a singular goal and that when that goal came through they felt they had succeeded she said that there was a great deal of argument and disagreement and ongoing contention within the civil rights movement throughout its history about what the movement ought to be prioritizing who should be prioritizing it who should be saying what what kinds of policy outcomes would be considered a win etc and that what we remember when we look back are the few things that were breakthrough moments like the voting rights act and the civil rights act and we think well any movement today should just have a very clear policy platform and goal and then they will get it she said that that is not true at all it is very natural for movements to be having these ongoing deliberations throughout their cycle because things change and all of these ideas are coming together and they are all having various influences on the agenda and the types of conversations and types of policies that are considered so yes there are clear platforms that are put forward things like the breathe act that emerge out of some of these conversations but that doesnt mean that there are not disagreements and that there are not new claims and new narratives that emerge along the way and that is fine and healthy it represents an adaptive movement and there is nothing wrong with that per se although it is definitely the case that having some single unifying commitment is helpful to avoid some of the fragmentation and splintering unfortunately when it is a lifeanddeath matter it makes it easier for people to stay united in the face of great opposition and setbacks to some extent it is easier for more reformist movements to splinter and to come up with factional fights where there are people trying to outradicalize one another than it is for movements that consider their goals a lifeanddeath matter and movements that prioritize that single purpose as professor woodly was saying of defense of black life are at less risk perhaps of fragmenting than movements that are expressing goals that feel less urgent to those who are affected by them deva woodly i will say just one thing in terms of framing to add on to what dr chenoweth has said if you have a strong overarching frame like black lives matter you can nest a lot of ideas underneath that frame that people can then index to that frame especially if you have good message discipline and that is indeed what has happened and that is intentional on the part of the movement who has not only legislation like the breathe act but also has a literal party platform that you can look up online at movementforblacklivesorg ting ting cheng just to follow up on this thread dr chenoweth i know that you are working on a new book about womens participation in the outcomes of mass movements to me a critical issue within the womens movement and overlapping with the movement for black lives is this idea of the fraught history of the womens movement being noninclusive especially with the alignment with criminal justice the womens movement a long time ago chose to align with the victims rights movement advocating for the recognition of domestic violence as a crime and very much leaning on using the criminal justice system for police intervention prosecution and harsher penalties which obviously disproportionately impact women of color and women in overpoliced communities even though black women and women of color have opposed placing the accountability on victims solely in the hands of law enforcement i think their voices were ignored throughout this evolution i dont know if you want to share any of your research on that or if your book touches on that erica chenoweth sure yes thanks for the question this is related to a project i am collaborating on with zoe marks basically what we find is that among the 627 mass mobilizations that i mentioned that have taken place between 1900 and 2020 is that those in which at least half of the people visible on the frontlines of the peak mobilizations in those movements are women from what we can tell those movements have a much higher chance of succeeding and a much higher chance in fact of initiating a kind of democratic transition that leads to more egalitarian democracy meaning a type of democracy where also resources are more even distributed across different social groups it raises the question of why what is it about womens frontline participation that leads to that kind of raising of all boats effect the answer is that first of all movements that exclude women are excluding 50 percent of the population the second is that they are excluding a major wealth of knowledge when it comes to social power and potential tactical innovations women are often situated such that wherever they are positioned in society they have good access to knowledge about how to withdraw cooperation and withhold economic power in order to put pressure on the opponent and its pillars of support in very meaningful ways some of the most important tactics that have been innovated over the past 120 years have been innovated by womens organizations and womens groups for example the boycott which is the product of the ladies land league in ireland learning how to make it very unpleasant and near impossible for british absentee landlords to come back to ireland and extract rents from their tenants there are lots of different examples of this and what your question reminds me of ting is the fact that we still need to keep an intersectional lens when we are talking about that that when we have women at the frontlines it doesnt necessarily mean that the structures of oppression that women are fighting against are affecting all of those women equally one of the things that is so powerful about many of the movements around the world right now is that there is more that is known about the way that the intersecting nature of oppression affects people differently and therefore why it is so important to bring the margins to the center and to center those who are closest to the pain such that if they are doing well we know that everyone else will be doing well too i think that is one of the most important insights that particularly black feminists have brought into actually the now mainstream public discourse over the past couple of generations ting ting cheng thank you i want to note the time here we should wrap up dr woodly do you have any concluding thoughts before we wrap up deva woodly i just want to say that i think this period of tumult while it is somewhat excruciating to live through is also a period of immense possibility it is a period of immense possibility because a lot of the assumptions that characterize mainstream discourse and even scholarly discourse at the end of the last century have been upended that gives us a chance to reimagine our community this imagined community and to implement changes that help our political philosophies align with material conditions in the world in a better way the one note of hope at the same time as the note of caution that professor chenoweth has put out that i want to say is that it is absolutely not a guarantee that things will go in the direction of more egalitarian justice but this is a moment in which our ability to shape institutions and notions of common sense is greater than it normally is the same kind of forces that allow folks to mobilize on the right among people with authoritarian tendencies to be posttruth or creating their own nonreality bubble also gives people who are in favor of egalitarianism and democracy the opportunity to reshape our notions of what counts as a wellfunctioning egalitarian polity and that is an opportunity that we should absolutely take up and that people are taking up again political organizing is the way political organizing is what helps to shape us into democratic citizens who are capable of muscular selfgovernance i find a lot of hope in the work that people are doing today on that account erica chenoweth i will just quickly give an anecdote to illustrate what professor woodly has just said this summer when we were tallying protests that were related to racial justice i knew that we were in a new world a different world when i was looking at an example where there was a town that was in a rural area about 150 protesters every last one of them white but holding signs quoting audre lorde saying your silence will not protect you i knew that we were in a totally different frame of mind then than we were in 2015 where people still thought that saying all lives matter was a gesture of solidarity before it became totally coopted the fact that now we have moved to a place where youth organizers are leading us into excavating the roots of black feminist liberation texts is showing us that we are in an exciting and creative process of transformation right now ting ting cheng thank you i love ending on this hopeful note we are going to wrap it up here to conclude i want to thank our tremendous speakers dr woodly and dr chenoweth thank you so much for

351,he is the man who vowed to “take back control” and “get brexit done” but as dominic cummings stalked out of downing street for the final time yesterday britain’s eu departure was far from resolved boris johnson’s chief aide cultivated a poisonous and pugnacious aura around the prime minister critics say and few people — particularly among conservative mps — will be sorry to see him go but now as the dust from a bombastic week in westminster settles minds will be focusing on the future and whether cummings’ exit might smooth the way for accord with brussels it’s undeniable that the 48yearold was pivotal in shaping johnson’s hardnosed brexit approach he masterminded the insurgent and successful vote leave campaign in 2016 was behind no 10’s sensational prorogation of parliament three years later  and rubberstamped the culling of tory mps who refused to support his boss’s strategy  cummings was ruthless and without him the government has surely lost a little of its brexit muscle this certainly appears to be the thinking in europe philippe lamberts a belgian mep who sits on the european parliament’s brexit committee said yesterday that the aide’s dismissal was likely a sign that johnson was beginning to bend to eu demands “i do believe that as long as dominic cummings was chief advisor to the prime minister a negotiated settlement and agreement was impossible because my deep belief is that he wanted the uk to exit the transition period without a deal” lamberts who leads the european parliament’s greens contingent told the bbc  more for you russia 2020 clues to putin’s plans for the future watch bill gates give brilliant 30second answers to common job interview questions nagarro proves that you don’t need headquarters and senior executives to be successful he and brussels colleagues have been emboldened by joe biden’s electoral success in america — the presidentelect is unlike his predecessor a staunch supporter of european integration and has made his disdain for johnson’s brexit approach clear  and yet as recently as thursday officials left the negotiating table in london no further forward the areas of impasse — fishing rights state aid rules and perhaps most prickly a regulatory level playing field — haven’t shifted for months and appear truly insurmountable both sides accuse the other of inflexibility from downing street the official line is cummings’ departure won’t change this “absolutely not” was a spokesperson’s response when asked whether the development would spark a softening of johnson’s stance this seems consistent with his decision to keep lord david frost the uk’s chief brexit negotiator and ardent believer that britain must not sacrifice its regulatory autonomy in post but the prime minister isn’t shy when it comes to screeching policy uturns  and the pressure on him to find a deal grows daily excluding spain britain is headed for the deepest coronavirusinduced recession in europe the european commission announced last week  with a significantly slower rate of recovery than the continent’s average with its economy already punctured by the pandemic britain can ill afford the eyewatering cost of nodeal experts say  time to reach an agreement is running dangerously short too deadlines have come and gone for months but a truly final cliffedge is crystallising around earlydecember should a deal be reached by then there’ll be just enough time for scrutiny and ratification before year’s end when the law dictates that britain must leave having cut ties with cummings a righthand man inclined towards nodeal now — if ever — seems the moment for johnson to rethink his don’tblinkfirst mentality the time for meaningful negotiating gymnastics has long since passed however at this eleventh hour concession is the only way forward short of his chief advisor its a call the prime minister must make solo prepared to suffer — or celebrate — the consequences alone alasdair lane i’m a ukbased journalist who’s worked at the sharp end of political broadcasting in westminster experienced the brexit brouhaha up close and interviewed some of the … read more i’m a ukbased journalist who’s worked at the sharp end of political broadcasting in westminster experienced the brexit brouhaha up close and interviewed some of the biggest names in uk and european policymaking after a stint as editor of my undergraduate student newspaper i found myself in london writing for among others the independent as the 2015 general election approached i took on a producer role at sky news working across the channel and on multiple platforms inspired by the heady political times i moved to sky’s westminster studio shortly after becoming a political news editor the intense fastpaced posting saw me direct the daily political coverage produce content going out live and interview some of the era’s biggest political hitters returning to my writing roots i continue to focus on british and eu politics as well as dabbling in wider foreign affairs,3

347,former health ministry directorgeneral moshe bar simantov has warned that the government’s policy on exiting israel’s second national lockdown to curb the coronavirus spread is misguided and will lead to another wave of infections the third since the start of the outbreak “morbidity is on the rise and we are making the same mistakes as last time” bar simantov said referring to the exit from a previous national lockdown that was followed by a second larger wave of infections bar simantov resigned as health ministry director in may after leading the nation’s response to the first wave of coronavirus his resignation came days after the cabinet voted against his recommendation to significantly ease coronavirus restrictions throughout the country a move widely seen now as a mistake get the times of israels daily edition by email and never miss our top stories free sign up in an interview with the yedioth ahronoth daily bar simantov said that an effective strategy for preventing spread in schools was a key to success and predicted that despite encouraging trials there will be no vaccine available before the end of winter excerpts of his comments were published on wednesday with the full interview to be included in the weekend paper there are “signs that indicate a third wave” of infections is coming bar simantov said and advised officials to find ways to keep the spread rate at a controllable level another national lockdown the third since the start of the outbreak is “certainly” a possibility he assessed children wearing face masks study in a classroom of the kramim school in jerusalem on their first day back to classes after a national lockdown november 1 2020 olivier fitoussiflash90 “the vector was and remains education” bar simantov said and criticized the current arrangement in which children in grades 14 study in pods of students who are kept separate during studies but in afterschool care programs members of as many as three pods are permitted to mingle “it is as though we aren’t doing anything to keep students separated” he said “aftercare is the weak point because that is where they mingle” he continued “that is the most significant thing in my opinion” the education system was blamed as a major contributor to the spike in infections that followed the previous lockdown any further opening of the education system should only be done with separated pods of students bar simantov advised regarding national coronavirus czar ronni gamzu’s socalled traffic light plan to divide the country into colorcoded areas based on local infection rates and then apply localized closures accordingly bar simantov said the method can only ever be partially effective because the restrictions are never hermetic “in jerusalem many of the workers in the green areas come from red areas” he said “it cannot be prevented in many ways israel is one epidemiological cell if tomorrow the government approves a wedding with the participation of up to 50 people then they will come from all regions” then health ministry director general manager moshe bar simantov at a press conference about the coronavirus covid19 at the prime ministers office in jerusalem on march 11 2020 flash90 with winter approaching flu infections which have been serious over the previous two years could put added burden on the healthcare system impacting the “very good to excellent” level of care that coronavirus patients have enjoyed so far “is hospital inefficiency a possibility if there is a serious flu alongside the coronavirus that could happen” bar simantov said “the winter is the biggest challenge at the moment for the health system” he noted predicting there will be no coronavirus vaccine available until after the coldest season of the year the recent reports from the usbased pfizer pharmaceutical corporation that its vaccine still under trial has had strong success are encouraging bar simantov said “there is hope here for something that might change the game” he said “i hope that the reports will continue to be optimistic but at the same time it is important to understand that we will spend the coming winter without the vaccine” health ministry figures released wednesday showed that there were 663 virus cases diagnosed the day before still above the target of 500 daily cases that health officials have identified as a condition for any further easing of the lockdown there are 8105 active patients 304 of whom are in serious condition with 126 on ventilators there have been 320849 cases in israel since the start of the outbreak and 2683 people have died a drop in the number of new daily cases achieved during the ongoing national lockdown has recently leveled off amid a gradual reopening leading prime minister benjamin netanyahu and health officials to warn that if the numbers begin to climb there will be no further easing of restrictions people stand in line outside stores in jerusalem after they were permitted to reopen following a national lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak on november 8 2020 yonatan sindelflash90 israel sharply brought down its daily coronavirus infection rates from some 8000 in midseptember to several hundred by late october with the nationwide lockdown its second since the start of the pandemic it has remained stubbornly above 500 a day though on most days with 30000 tests or more the lockdown paralyzed much of public life and the economy and shuttered the entire education system the government began removing some restrictions a few weeks ago opening preschools and kindergartens then grades

126,the harakat shabaab almujahidinâcommonly known as alshabaabâwas   the militant wing of the somali council of islamic courts that took   over most of southern somalia in the second half of 2006 despite the group’s defeat by somali and ethiopian forces in 2007 alshabaabâa clanbased insurgent and terrorist groupâhas   continued its violent insurgency in southern and central somalia the   group has exerted temporary and at times sustained control over   strategic locations in those areas by recruiting sometimes forcibly   regional subclans and their militias using guerrilla   warfare and terrorist tactics against the federal government of somalia   fgs african union mission in somalia amisom peacekeepers and   nongovernmental aid organizations since 2011 however pressure from   amisom and ethiopian forces has largely degraded alshabaab’s   control especially in mogadishu but also in other key regions of the   country and conflict among senior leaders has exacerbated fractures   within the group in 2013 alshabaab rivalries culminated in a major purge of opponents of nowdeceased group leader ahmed abdi awmohamed  as evidenced by the constant levels of infighting among leadership alshabaab is not centralized or monolithic in its agenda or goals its rankandfile   members come from disparate clans and the group is susceptible to clan   politics internal divisions and shifting alliances most of its   fighters are predominantly interested in the nationalistic battle   against the fgs and not supportive of global jihad alshabaab’s senior leaders remain affiliated with alqa‘ida the merger of the two groups was publicly announced in february 2012 by the amir of alshabaab and ayman alzawahiri leader of alqa‘ida the group however has lost four senior figuresâincluding abdiâsince september 2014 which may have hampered its communications with alqa‘ida leadership alshabaab has claimed responsibility for many bombingsâincluding various types of suicide attacksâin   mogadishu and in central and northern somalia typically targeting   somali government officials amisom and perceived allies of the fgs   since 2013 alshabaab has launched highprofile   operations in neighboring countries most notably the september 2013   westgate mall attack in nairobi  the may 2014 attack against a   restaurant in djibouti popular with westerners and the april 2015   massacre of university students in garissa kenya the westgate attack   killed 67 kenyan and nonkenyan nationals and a siege continued at the mall for several days the garissa attack killed some 150 mainly christian students alshabaab is responsible for the assassination of somali peace activists international aid workers numerous civil society figures and journalists and for blocking the delivery of aid from some western relief agencies during the 2011 famine that killed tens of thousands of somalis in 2008 the us government designated alshabaab   as a foreign terrorist organization under section 219 of the   immigration and nationality act as amended and as a specially   designated global terrorist entity under section 1b of executive order   13224 as amended in 2012 the rewards for justice program added   several alshabaab leaders to its site offering large rewards for information leading to their capture                                 national

104,key points • awd is a small neonazi group whose members are preparing for a race war to combat what they consider the cultural and racial displacement of the white race  • awd which is made up of online groups and small localized cells spreads their hateful propaganda via the internet and by distributing provocative fliers posters and stickers • members who meet and organize online participate in “hate camps” organized hiking excursions and militarystyle training exercises across the country • members have participated in white supremacist rallies and events organized by other white supremacist groups • members and associates have been linked to violent crimes including murder and alleged plots to attack civilians nuclear facilities and synagogues • a series of arrests in 201920 has decimated the groups active membership origins atomwaffen division awd is a small neonazi group that became active in 2016 the group is believed to have originated online from a nowdefunct neonazi forum called iron march which was known for its extreme content and calls for violence  according to the awd website they are “a revolutionary national socialist organization centered around political activism and the practice of an autonomous fascist lifestyle”  they promote the idea that societal and governmental “systems” are collapsing and that democracy and capitalism have “given way to jewish oligarchies and globalist bankers resulting in the cultural and racial displacement of the white race”  members train in preparation for an impending race war and promote the use of violence to reach their goal of “uncompromising victory” in a promotional video published on january 21 2018 members dressed in militarystyled camouflaged fatigues shout “gas the kikes” and “race war now” as they fire weapons and practice tactical maneuvers  in december 2017 one of awd’s leaders john cameron denton aka vincent snyder laid out the group’s plans on their siege culture website “our responsibility right now is resistance anything that happens after that we’ll simply adapt to it and work with what we have” denton who lives in texas has attended white supremacist rallies and events in houston and austin alongside members of the white lives matter movement and the aryan renaissance society atomwaffen members have a macabre fascination with serial killer charles manson and his vision of a race war between whites and blacks for this reason in 2017 denton and other atomwaffen members sought out neonazi manson devotee and former american nazi party member james nolan mason and republished some of his writing including siege a book based on a collection of newsletters mason wrote in the 1980s  in addition to charles manson awd members pay tribute to other white men who’ve committed mass murders including dylann roof anders breivik ted kaczynski and timothy mcveigh even referring to the latter three as “the father the son and the holy spirit”  atomwaffen draws some of its influences from satanic ideas and beliefs  required and recommended reading lists for atomwaffen’s “aspiring initiates” include books that draw on satanic and occult themes while some atomwaffen members promote a particular version of  satanism known as “the order of nine angles” commonly abbreviated as ona or o9a which is steeped in neonazi themes that praise adolf hitler promote holocaust denial and identify jews as the enemy the order of nine angles’ spiritual leader anton long which may be a pseudonym for david myatt is a notorious british neonazi leader with a violent criminal history siege culture an atomwaffen website promotes long’s book hostia secret teachings of the order of nine angles an instructional guide for wouldbe o9a members that encourages “satanic novices” to undergo a personal transformation to achieve a more revolutionary mindset suggestions include enlisting in a police force championing heretical views becoming a professional burglar and joining the armed forces in wartime to gain combat experience atomwaffen members participate in “hate camp” hiking excursions and militarystyle training exercises these camps are used to prepare members for eventual societal collapse and to indoctrinate new members the first known hate camp took place in illinois’ shawnee national forest in late september 2017 and reportedly drew fewer than 12 participants other camps have been held in death valley california washington state and texas   activity attributed to atomwaffen has been reported in multiple states including california colorado florida illinois pennsylvania texas massachusetts washington north carolina and virginia  the group’s propaganda often promotes violence against minority communities including lgbtq people jews muslims and african americans awd now extends beyond america into europe and includes a german offshoot in mid2018 a video entitled “an atomwaffen announcement” surfaced it began “greetings from germany” from a masked atomwaffen man speaking in german and then in english  his message to his american neonazis included “also here we prepare for the last long fight soon to come sieg heil”  more recently reports of this awd cell made news after death threats allegedly associated with awd were reported against german politicians cem özdemir and claudia roth  according to media reports the threats included at the moment we are planning how and when we will execute you at the next public rally or will we get you in front of your home   siege culture james mason’s writings have had a profound impact on the atomwaffen division and the group has embraced the ideology of siege as their own the book is required reading for new atomwaffen members and it forms the apocalyptic heart of the group’s core tenets otherwise known as “siege culture” siege culture also spelled siegekultur is a philosophy political orientation and spiritual outlook dominated by hate and anchored in fascist ideology  adherents are urged to drop out of a “corrupt” system even as they engage in direct attacks against it under the influence of awd leader john cameron denton siege culture departs from mason’s writings to incorporate elements of occultism and even satanism james mason publicly denies having any direct ties to awd but his involvement appears to run deep audio recordings of mason speaking on the group’s behalf have been posted to awd’s siege culture website and a recent photograph shows mason wearing an atomwaffen patch surrounded by members of the group  james mason pictured with atomwaffen members in an atomwaffen video entitled “nuclear congress”   atomwaffen’s embrace of mason has elevated the author and his writings within the white supremacist movement  in recent years new international white supremacist groups have embraced the violent rhetoric of siege culture including sonnenkrieg division feuerkrieg division vorherrschaft division and the base      alleged members of atomwaffen and the base sonnenkrieg division white supremacist organization sonnenkrieg division skd which launched online in 2018 has strong ties to atomwaffen skd is predominantly focused on political and social issues in europe specifically the uk and eastern europe and its members take a nihilistic view of the world which they seek to destroy there is significant overlap in skd and awds core ideologies use of graphics and imagery rhetoric crosspromotion and communication  like atomwaffen sonnenkrieg rails against a perceived cultural and racial obliteration of the white race and glorifies the teachings of siege author james mason  on june 18 2019 two alleged members of skd michal szewczuk and oskar dunnkoczorowski were convicted of promoting terrorism and neonazi propaganda online  the pair came to the attention of authorities after they posted an image online of prince harry with a gun to his head and the caption “see ya later race traitor” dunnkoczorowski was sentenced to 18 months in detention and szewczuk was sentenced to four years in prison authorities arrested another member of the neonazi organization andrew dymock on december 4 2019 and charged him with 12 counts including encouraging people to commit terrorism disseminating terrorist publications terrorist fundraising and possessing material useful to terrorists  iron march the fascist social networking platform “iron march” was founded in 2011 by russian nationalist alisher mukhitdinov aka alexander slavros as a “central communications hub for its members online as well as the hq for the online fascist space and the primary source for studying our worldview thus acting as the fascist alma mater”  this slogan for this online “global fascist fraternity” underscores its antisemitic and racist agenda “gas the kikes race war now 1488 boots on the ground”  atomwaffen division is one of the site’s legacies many of the group’s initial networks were forged on iron march forums following the may 2017 murder of two atomwaffen members allegedly at the hands of former awd member devon arthurs see below iron march’s administrator posted a disclaimer “ironmarch endorses atomwaffen but we are separate entities do not directly conflate one with the other… we are foremost a place of learning and as such we provide these groups with educational materials advice if it is asked for and a platform for their voice…” iron march served as a global online meeting space for individuals to communicate with others who embraced similar extremist views helping to radicalize and indoctrinate those engaged on the site the topics on the forum were under different subsections “news” highlighted current events related to fascism and nationalism “the beer hall” was dedicated to discussions on topics such as “the jewish question” “militarism sports and fitness” and “race and ethnic relations” “race war central” included regional and countryspecific content and “concentration camp” included a subforum “the showers” referencing the nazi extermination camps with the description “they come in but they don’t come out” at the height of its popularity the site attracted more than 15000 users iron march was shut down in november 2017 but in november 2019 data associated with the forum was leaked to the public exposing user details messages and other revealing information including insight into individuals who claimed to have ties to the us military the fallout from the data leak has included the unmasking of several forum users and has highlighted the forum’s broad geographic reach as well as the relative youth of its users atomwaffen related us arrests devon arthurs and brandon russell the awd florida chapter once considered the largest in the country took a major hit in may 2017 when devon arthurs a former atomwaffen member who converted to islam allegedly murdered two of his roommates atomwaffen members jeremy himmelman and andrew oneschuk  an investigation following the murders revealed that a fourth atomwaffen florida member brandon russell aka odin sometimes named in media reports as the group’s national leader had been collecting explosive materials in his apartment russell fled but was quickly arrested by police arthurs told law enforcement that awd planned to use explosives to attack civilians nuclear power facilities and synagogues in the florida area in january 2018 russell who pleaded guilty to possessing an unregistered destructive device and unlawful storage of explosive materials was sentenced to five years in

355,“one may be the loneliest number that you will ever do” despite the lyrical lament by the 1970’s rock band three dog night  it appears that more people than ever are choosing singlehood november 11 is singles day  a holiday that began in china in 1993 the day of celebration was conjured up by university students to celebrate their “freedom” from a significant other november 11 was named the day for celebration because of the symbolic power of four single sticks of 1’s in the date 1111 while the holiday may have begun with college students looking for a reason to party it is now recognized as the single largest shopping day in the world singles day has spread throughout asia and has now found its way to europe the solo lifestyle celebration is now part of retail advertising campaigns in the united states and canada but there’s something more to singles day than retail sales it is an indicator of a larger demographic trend that may change the face of caregiving and life in retirement living life as a party of one is becoming more popular the general social survey indicates that more than half of young american millennials between 18 and 34 years old do not have a significant other likewise canadians between ages 20 and 34 years old living without a partner has risen to a 20year high statistics indicate that nearly six in 10 young canadians have not found their other half romance aside not having a partner has implications for other life roles and retirement singles day falls squarely in the middle of november national family caregivers month  first lady rosalynn carter is quoted as observing that there are only four kinds of people in the world those who have been caregivers  those who are currently caregivers  those who will be caregivers  and those who will need caregivers  living single for an extended period or as a lifelong choice presents a different dynamic for caregiving and living in older age more for you how much should you withdraw from retirement savings annually features of a fixed index annuity surrender charges retirement income statements can be a trap for the unwary data suggest that traditional life stages such as finding a partner and having children are occurring at older ages than previous generations us centers for disease control data and statistics canada data show that the only cohort of women with an increasing birthrate are women over 40years old that is not necessarily a problem but having children closer to traditional midlife may collide with other family roles such as caring for an aging parent a 40year old mother with a newborn or toddler is likely to have a parent that is much older and have more needs than a firsttime mother in her 30s extended singlehood and delays in having children are likely to intensify the challenges of balancing career and children with caring for aging parents – making the coming sandwich generation of millennials feel more like a hardpressed panini to manage the competing demands and related stress of career children and caregiving some people may forgo higher paying jobs for positions that do not demand long hours or travel others may choose parttime work while many may be forced to leave the workforce altogether each of these choices are likely to have an impact on today’s income and tomorrow’s retirement security and if today’s trend of adult daughters acting as primary caregivers of aging parents continues it will be women who are likely to be caught in the coming caregiving crunch by decision or by default not everyone will find a significant other living solo in younger years is one experience however aging alone is quite another most people age well not because of what they have saved not necessarily because they follow doctor‘s orders but because of a strong social and family network of support duties from taking out the trash changing light bulbs grocery shopping cooking medication management to countless other other chores that are often informally shared between a couple are now on the shoulders of one selfcare as an older person living alone will require far more preparation than what is offered by traditional retirement planning moreover additional retirement income will be necessary to purchase and provide the services traditionally shared with a partner eg transportation home health care food shopping over time it is highly likely that many of today’s single millennials will drive up the number of single older people today approximately 27 of people in the united states and canada over age 60 live alone – given current trends in living single can we envision nearly half or more of older adults living solo in coming decades if so individuals and financial professionals should focus less on traditional retirement planning and focus more on longevity planning to understand and to prepare for the practical implications of choices made across the life course on life in older age joseph

mogadishu in august 2011 following an offensive spearheaded by about 22000 african union au troops and left the vital port of kismayo in september 2012 the loss of kismayo has hit alshababs finances as it used to earn money by taking a cut of the citys lucrative charcoal trade the us has also carried out a wave of air strikes which led to the killing of the groups leader aden hashi ayro in 2008 and his successor ahmed abdi godane  in march 2017 us president donald trump approved a pentagon plan to escalate operations against alshabab the us has more than 500 troops in somalia and conducted 30 airstrikes in 2017 more than four times the average number carried out in the previous seven years according to the washington post  although the military operations are weakening alshabab the group is still able to carry out suicide attacks and has regained control of some towns  the au is reducing its troop presence  about 1000 have left and a further 1000 are due to leave in 2018  this follows a cut in funding by the european union eu amid allegations of corruption within the au force made up of troops from uganda burundi kenya ethiopia and djibouti   somalia has not had an effective national government for more than 20 years during which much of the country has been a warzone  alshabab gained support by promising people security but its credibility was knocked when it rejected western food aid to combat a 2011 drought and famine  with mogadishu and other towns now under government control there is a feeling of optimism and many somalis have returned from exile bringing their money and skills with them basic services such as street lighting dry cleaning and rubbish collection have resumed in the capital but somalia is still too dangerous and divided to hold democratic elections  the last one was in 1969  so its parliament and president are elected through a complex system with clan elders playing an influential role in the process somalias touch and feel

350,we stand at the threshold of a technological revolution as elon musk recently explained to an audience of military personnel “the fighter jet era has passed” speaking with lieutenant general john thompson at the air warfare symposium the technology executive praised the us military but stressed the fact that autonomous drone warfare had arrived the truth is that musk did not go far enough not only are we witnessing the end of fighter jets we are witnessing the end of the industrialera military itself like the creaking decline of detroit automakers so the world’s industrialera institutions are now poised to be displaced or transformed by a rising era of artificial intelligence ai and machine learning ml this is not a minor shift indeed what we are now facing is a complete redesign of a fading industrial order as ray dalio observes we are entering a new global era  this transition portends a dramatic shift away from rudimentary machines and toward precision electronics  more to the point it signals a structural transformation in the nature of global security with implications for america’s military predominance beyond climate change much as mass electrification accelerated the rise of the united states so ai has begun transforming the contours of the global order  ai is a general purpose technology with a capacity to reshape the nature of global security underlying this shift is the rise of technologies that leverage energy decentralization and electronics in remaking industrial era technologies in the case of energy— solar wind and battery capacity are now driving an exponential decline in the cost of energy  more for you a scoville heat scale for measuring the progress of emerging technologies in 2021 samsung and xilinx build a super smart ssd how the department of the air force is driving forward with ai since 2010 solar photovoltaic pv capacity costs have fallen over 80 while onshore wind capacity costs have fallen more than 45 and lithiumion battery capacity costs have fallen almost 90 as the cost curve for renewables ultimately plummets to nearzero  the shift to cleantech will become a major disrupter of conventional militaries add to this datadriven advances in ai and ml and what we are beginning to see is a complete technological restructuring conventional forecasts on technology often make the common error of assuming that system changes of this magnitude simply replace old technologies on a 1to1 basis in reality disruptions on this scale tend to disproportionately replace old systems with dramatically new architectures boundaries and capabilities  indeed even as the industrial era winds down  technological innovation is speeding up disruptions of this magnitude are driven by the convergence of technological and institutional changes that trigger causal feedback loops — pushing existing systems into accelerated decline with a fraction of the parts needed for fossil fuel technologies electricitydriven technologies are not only cheaper and easier to maintain but subject to the same accelerating returns as other digital technologies  power in the postindustrial era the impact of past technological revolutions can provide some perspective on the changing nature of contemporary institutions building on fossil fuels britain and the united states became globe spanning empires today industrial era technologies print television automobiles and the institutions that gave rise to them are now in decline to take one example the oil industry is now undergoing a structural collapse as recently as 2013  exxon was the largest company in the world in the third quarter of this year the energy giant reported a loss of 680 million bringing its total losses for 2020 to 237 billion as countries leverage data electronics and software automation to compete for military and commercial advantage they are beginning to transition beyond fossil fuels and into a massively competitive global market for innovation according to the international energy agency iea  renewables are now set to account for almost 90 of all new global power capacity through 2025 by 2030 renewables will provide the cheapest electricity option for most regions of the world while oil and gas are reduced to stranded assets  indeed blackrock— the worlds largest asset manager— views clean energy as a 10 trillion dollar market given this shift the us military now finds itself in a very precarious position currently the world’s largest consumer of fossil fuels  the us military is now on course to be disrupted by more strategically innovative competitors as energy costs fall to near zero the nature of global security will change dramatically the good news is that the military has already begun making strides in transforming its dependence on fossil fuels according to a department of defense report  the armed forces nearly doubled renewable power generation and nearly tripled renewable energy projects between 2011 and 2015 what is clear is that ai and renewables are a force multiplier for transformative innovation in generating a much stealthier military footprint clean energy means reducing the vulnerability of easily attacked convoys dependent on refueling  it also means a massive windfall in financial resources for next generation military innovation and most importantly it means a highly mobile renewable energy infrastructure at nearzero cost the next global order ﻿ we are living through a period of transition between two epochs an industrial era characterized by predictable factory labor and a new digital era characterized by widespread institutional unravelling this unravelling builds on structural changes rooted in 1 technological transformation ai 2 geopolitical restructuring the rise of china and 3 environmental crisis climate change china’s growing economic largesse and its strategic investments in clean energy  autonomous weapons  and precisionguided missiles signals a dramatic shift in the nature of military power china is moving to adopt intelligent systems that will fully automate parts of its’ enormous economy while leading the world in renewables  these investments will eventually drive a broad transformation of china’s military with other countries following suit in this new century the united states remains a formidable power but its days of unipolar hegemony have come to an end disruptive technologies like ai and renewables are transforming the contours of power driving the need for new institutions in managing a changing economic order beyond centralization rethinking security what we know already is that a massive data revolution is accelerating a convergence of physical digital and biological technologies around software and automation  datadriven technologies are now the core infrastructure around which a global society operates in fact the idc estimates that global data is now growing at an annual rate of 61 data is expected to reach 175 zettabytes by 2025 a trillion gigabytes and these technologies are now fragmenting state power given the scale of proliferating technologies in driving nonstate actors and asymmetrical challenges it would be wrong to assume that we can simply renew the institutions inherited from a previous century and given the scope of these changes we can assume that america’s lead in military predominance will fade unless specific investments are made in transforming the institutions of the military itself in a century characterized by asymmetrical threats cyber biological and ecological us leadership has begun to wane from climate change to cyberconflict and from political deadlock to a populist revolt  rage and resentment are on the rise across western democracies and american leadership looks increasingly hollow  the truth is that centralized institutions of all kinds are now extremely vulnerable to disruption as cuttingedge technologies become cheaper they spread to a wider range of actors democratizing the capacity for nonstate actors to create and leverage force at scale the move to increasing decentralization will inevitably mean the end of large bureaucracies corporate government academic and military and command hierarchies but it will also mean the rise of asymmetrical security challenges transforming the us military for the network age with an armed force of more than two million people 11 nuclear aircraft carriers 70 submarines and the world’s most advanced military technologies  the us remains the predominant military power but with the rise of competing nations— china russia india iran and turkey— the balance of power is shifting indeed as eurasia group’s ian bremmer declares  the usled global order is already finished the geopolitical landscape has begun shifting and many analysts now worry that the united states is in structural decline  the bad news is that the end of pax americana would likely open a global power vacuum indeed nationstates private firms and nonstate actors that can weaponize ai and renewables could soon have a degree of political economic and military influence that we simply have never seen before without a us military designed for the 21 st century the potential for chaos could grow exponentially part of the answer will involve the evolution of new local institutions that can secure a datadriven era in the form of a second bretton woods system while devolving power to the local level more than anything else this will mean developing a comprehensive security and military network that can help guide the transition out of a collapsing industrial order  to be sure designing new security institutions that feed on and manage this “creative destruction” will be daunting the challenge before us today is to leverage the affordances of this fourth industrial revolution to redesign america’s military and security systems for a network age much as oil and steel set the terms for the industrial age so ai and renewables will now set the terms for the digital age and as autonomous machines  renewable energy infrastructure  quantum communication  augmented brainmachine interfaces  and spacebased weapons come to the fore pressure will grow to rethink the nature of global security in the era of complex networks localized selfsufficient communities local nodes will simply be better equipped to respond to accelerating technological change indeed this is the driving premise underlying the design and evolution of the internet itself managing a thorny cluster of challenges that crisscross nonstate actors diffuse criminal organizations geopolitical competitors and the proliferation of autonomous weapons means rethinking the nature of security for a new global order transforming the us military for the 21 st century will mean deploying automation aidriven simulations and renewables to a substantial extent building on clean energy technologies and software automation the military will need to return to first principles harnessing ai and human intuition to aid and eventually lead in decisionmaking while deploying special operations forces when needed but more than resources alone this will mean transforming the institutions of the us military for a network age daniel araya daniel araya phd is a

357,with the united states election over and joseph joe biden the victor human rights watch said he should make human rights a priority of his upcoming presidency at home and abroad biden has pledged to prioritise human rights in his foreign policy governments across the globe including zimbabwe are also contemplating the implications of a biden administration for their countries on november 7 zimbabwe president emmerson mnangagwa posted a congratulatory message on twitter saying he looked forward to working with biden to increase cooperation between zimbabwe and the us mnangagwas foreign affairs minister sibusiso moyo said his congratulatory tweet the next day that zimbabwe hopes to continue finding common ground worthwhile and mutual alliances with the american people as a us senator in 2001 biden cosponsored the zimbabwe democracy and economic recovery act which paved the way for the us to impose travel and economic sanctions on individuals and their associates responsible for the deliberate breakdown of the rule of law politically motivated violence and intimidation in zimbabwe these targeted sanctions have been imposed since 2003 on select individuals in the ruling zanu pf government and companies known to facilitate human rights abuses undermine the rule of law and engage in looting public resources for personal or political gain some of the companies sanctioned include mbada diamonds marange resources sakunda holdings the militaryrun zimbabwe defence industries and zanu pf linked companies such as ms syndicate and jongwe printing and publishing company the fact is that a reset of relations with the us government and the removal of targeted sanctions is unlikely to happen simply because there is a new administration in the us zimbabwe authorities should carry out substantial credible reforms end abuses end corruption and open up democratic space the reforms should include in line with section 210 of the zimbabwe constitution the establishment of an effective and independent mechanism for receiving and investigating complaints from members of the public about security services misconduct and to remedy any harm caused by such misconduct since coming to power in 2017 the mnangagwa administration has made several calls for the us government to remove sanctions on senior government officials in zimbabwe mnangagwa and top government officials have sought to blame their failure to revive the countrys battered economy and attract foreign investment on sanctions an umbrella term used to deflect criticisms of the governments poor performance ahead of zimbabwes july 2018 national elections the ruling zanu pf party in its manifesto promised a new dispensation for zimbabwe from being a pariah state to a new era of hope in which peoples aspirations are fulfilled but even though mnangagwa has repeatedly voiced his commitments to human rights reforms his administration remains highly intolerant to criticism peaceful dissent and free expression the zimbabwe government has not carried out the promised reforms that could lead to the removal of targeted sanctions in january us senators jim risch chairperson of the senate foreign relations committee and chris coons member of the subcommittee on africa and global health policy said in a statement it is important that the us communicate to the people of zimbabwe that our sanctions programmes are aimed at deterring human rights abuses public corruption the undermining of democratic processes or institutions and political repression in zimbabwe they are not aimed at the zimbabwean people the senators added that while the targeted sanctions have been in place the us has continued to invest in humanitarian and development aid for zimbabwe spending more than us2 billion over the last 10 years in an october 23 interview with the voice of america the us ambassador to zimbabwe brian nichols said i think its important to stress that the united states does not have sanctions against the economy or people of zimbabwe our sanctions target those who engage in corruption violate human rights and undermine democratic processes in zimbabwe in fact our sanctions have only 83 individuals and 37 entities that is to say companies or organisations linked to those people that have either committed human rights abuses or engaged in corruption nichols further stated that the zimbabwe government should carry out the reforms necessary for the us to lift the targeted sanctions we have consistently pressed the government of zimbabwe to implement the necessary political democratic and economic reforms consistent with the international human rights obligations to provide zimbabwean citizens the prosperity security and wellbeing that they deserve he said if those things happen there would be no need for sanctions instead of implementing credible human rights reforms the zimbabwe government in recent months appears to be rapidly sliding backward to its previous history of unbridled disregard for human rights during mnangagwas presidency there has been a steady increase in serious human rights violations committed by the security forces including violent attacks abductions torture and other abuses against the opposition and civil society activists these abuses have been committed with impunity as no security force personnel have been arrested or prosecuted for their alleged involvement including in cases of abductions and torture last year alone suspected state security agents abducted and tortured over 70 critics of the government in midjanuary 2019 the security forces used excessive lethal force to crush nationwide protests that had been triggered by mnangagwas sudden announcement of a fuel price increase during demonstrations throughout zimbabwe the security forces fired live ammunition killing 17 people and raped at least 17 women the previous year on august 1 2018 postelection protests over delayed election results

found that six people died and 35 others were injured as a result of actions by the state security forces some of the commissions recommendations which have yet to be implemented include ensuring that those responsible for abuses are held accountable and setting up a special committee to compensate families of those killed or for lost property zimbabwe authorities need to reform the security forces so that they completely end their involvement in partisan politics and ensure that they act professionally in a rightsrespecting manner for the past serious human rights violations  including arbitrary arrests torture murder and rape  the government should order prompt investigations carry out their recommendations and those from the motlanthe commission including prosecuting members of the security force involved in accordance with national law and international standards zimbabwe authorities should not pin their hopes on improved relations with the us under the incoming biden administration rather they should focus on fully implementing the provisions of zimbabwes constitution that guarantee protection of human rights and do more to improve the lives of ordinary zimbabweans if mnangagwa fulfills the promises he has made about human rights and respect for the rule of law it will pave way for zimbabwes reengagement with the us and other concerned governments

271,by bbc monitoring french daily le monde published two articles on chinas growing influence in the indopacific region one linking it to frances involvement with other regional powers to contain it there were no reports about french ties with russia or iran all french media dedicated most of their international news coverage to the us elections and the fighting in nagornokarabakh the covid pandemic in france and elsewhere was also widely covered in frances three main dailies le monde le figaro and les echos indopacific xxl alliance to counter china in two articles for le monde 14 nov nathalie guibert and brice pedroletti looked at the new emerging geostrategic landscape in the indopacific region and at frances greater involvement in it in the first article they set the scene of this new challenging geopolitical situation marked by greater links and closer military cooperation between the united states india australia and japan within the quadrilateral security dialogue quad which they label an xxl alliance to counter china this guibert and pedroletti saed results from concerns on their part as they are facing chinas territorial claims an increase in its naval forces and a neocolonialist policy to respond these countries are readjusting their strategies notably within quad their foreign ministers met in tokyo on 6 october in the midst of the covid19 pandemic to discuss strategy to face the chinese giant in the indopacific space following the meeting us secretary of state mike pompeo embarked on an extensive tour of asia starting with india then sri lanka the maldives indonesia and vietnam to promote the defence of a free and open indopacific indopacific is a worlds pivotal region the current centre of gravity for maritime trade and growth guibert and pedroletti say high level tactical manoeuvres and wider themes more countries joining to highlight quad countries closer links frigates and helicopters from the us australian japanese and indian navies trained together in the bay of bengal as part of the malabar exercises at the beginning of november these highlevel tactical manoeuvres the first by the four quads naval forces after a test run in 2007 were marked by australias return guibert and pedroletti write from 17 to 20 november the us aircraft carrier nimitz and the indian aircraft carrier vikramaditya the indian navys flagship will be joined by australian and japanese ships in the western part of the indian ocean off the coast of goa the indopacific concept now encompasses multiple themes technologies environment fishing resources etc and other states france has joined in as a neighbour putting forward its overseas territories and their huge exclusive economic zone eez  the worlds second largest the journalists quote valerie niquet director of the foundation for strategic research asia centre as saying that the indopacific concept is not opposed to the emergence of china but to the fact that worryingly it is emerging with a global power strategy marked by a very particular internal system that of an ultraauthoritarian nationalist and aggressive communist party this concern is leading the countries concerned to have converging ideas and common denominators such as values the freedom of navigation at sea and the rejection of force to change the status quo guibert and pedroletti recall beijings territorial claims ranging from a swathe of reefs to the island state of taiwan as well as its historic rights over the entire south china sea china they write considers that its access to the ocean is hampered by groups of archipelagos owned by japan the philippines taiwan borneo or the mariana islands china wants to drive the americans out of this region where they have been since the end of the second world war they say beijing is therefore trying to weaken subvert and unravel american military alliances by imposing itself as a benevolent asian big brother in the indian ocean they write china is advancing its pawns through port concessions but also through transport and telecommunications infrastructures  its silk routes the chinese navy capacity has continued to grow to the point where it now lines up 350 ships compared with 300 for the united states this mass is worrying not because it would be used for a deliberate aggression but because it is likely to eventually exhaust western countries whose naval forces numbers are limited to compensate for this unfavourable asymmetry they decided to tighten their network of alliances in the indopacific beijing denounce naval drills on 3 november the chinese communist party global times daily denounced the malabar naval drills and attempts by the us to turn quad founding states into an asian nato with the usa likely to draw other regional countries into its military orbit in the foreseeable future however the worsening americanchinese confrontation swelled the ranks of a nonaligned camp in which france in particular hopes to play a role japan is at the origin of the indopacific concept in a speech to the indian parliament on the confluence of the two seas in august 2007 thenprime minister shinzo abe mentioned indian and japanese responsibility to safeguard these seas of freedom the same year the very first quad meeting was held following this initiative inclusive french strategy in indopacific in a second article linked to the first one and published the same day guibert and pedroletti looked at frances different approach drawing on the strength of its overseas departments and territories in this zone france defends a multilateralist strategy visavis china different from that advocated by the quad they write in the indopacific region the time is ripe for minilateralism with flexible coalitions of small groups of countries set up according to shared interests and areas of influence this logic supports the parisdelhicanberra axis which president macron described during his visit to australia in 2018 as absolutely key for the region and our common goals in the indopacific zone faced with chinas hegemonic challenge france calls for a true new geostrategic order and quickly abandoned the term axis seeking to appear inclusive now by cooperating with malaysia vietnam japan etc tokyo and paris have thus signed technology transfer and logistical support agreements in 2016 and 2018 on 4 november the french foreign ministry appointed an ambassador for the indopacific christophe penot a former ambassador to australia one of his missions will be to make the concept understood by the other ministries paris bases its legitimacy on its overseas departments and territories which bring together 16 million of its citizens and more than 90 per cent of the nine million square kilometres of its entire exclusive economic zone eez which includes wallis and futuna new caledonia and polynesia in the pacific the reunion island and mayotte in the indian ocean guibert and pedroletti quote a senior french military official as saying that in this large area france can present itself as a neighbour and not as an outside power which is particularly important for dialogue with partners promoting a wellbalanced position between washington and beijing frances scarce military resources make security cooperation essential faced with beijings conquering sovereignty france lacks the means to protect its strategic supports the french armed forces have only 7000 personnel few ships and even fewer planes in the region the french general staff regularly stresses that everything that is not monitored is plundered it is convinced that a war could be triggered by a fishingrelated incident a surveillance effort was launched from papeete in french polynesia in 2020 security cooperation has become vital along one line showing a presence defending freedom of navigation in areas threatened by beijings aggressive sanctuarisation india shares frances interest in the western indian ocean  not

held their first trilateral dialogue on 9 september increased number of military exercises france is taking part in military exercises in the region with the quads major partners the objective is to

92,to revisit this article select my⁠ ⁠account then view saved stories to revisit this article visit my profile then view saved stories by dexter filkins last february some of iran’s most influential leaders gathered at the amir almomenin mosque in northeast tehran inside a gated community reserved for officers of the revolutionary guard they had come to pay their last respects to a fallen comrade hassan shateri a veteran of iran’s covert wars throughout the middle east and south asia was a senior commander in a powerful élite branch of the revolutionary guard called the quds force the force is the sharp instrument of iranian foreign policy roughly analogous to a combined cia and special forces its name comes from the persian word for jerusalem which its fighters have promised to liberate since 1979 its goal has been to subvert iran’s enemies and extend the country’s influence across the middle east shateri had spent much of his career abroad first in afghanistan and then in iraq where the quds force helped shiite militias kill american soldiers shateri had been killed two days before on the road that runs between damascus and beirut he had gone to syria along with thousands of other members of the quds force to rescue the country’s besieged president bashar alassad a crucial ally of iran in the past few years shateri had worked under an alias as the quds force’s chief in lebanon there he had helped sustain the armed group hezbollah which at the time of the funeral had begun to pour men into syria to fight for the regime the circumstances of his death were unclear one iranian official said that shateri had been “directly targeted” by “the zionist regime” as iranians habitually refer to israel on january 2 2020 suleimani was killed on president trump’s orders was this an act of war read robin wright’s report at the funeral the mourners sobbed and some beat their chests in the shiite way shateri’s casket was wrapped in an iranian flag and gathered around it were the commander of the revolutionary guard dressed in green fatigues a member of the plot to murder four exiled opposition leaders in a berlin restaurant in 1992 and the father of imad mughniyeh the hezbollah commander believed to be responsible for the bombings that killed more than two hundred and fifty americans in beirut in 1983 mughniyeh was assassinated in 2008 purportedly by israeli agents in the ethos of the iranian revolution to die was to serve before shateri’s funeral ayatollah ali khamenei the country’s supreme leader released a note of praise “in the end he drank the sweet syrup of martyrdom” kneeling in the second row on the mosque’s carpeted floor was major general qassem suleimani the quds force’s leader a small man of fiftysix with silver hair a closecropped beard and a look of intense selfcontainment it was suleimani who had sent shateri an old and trusted friend to his death as revolutionary guard commanders he and shateri belonged to a small fraternity formed during the sacred defense the name given to the iraniraq war which lasted from 1980 to 1988 and left as many as a million people dead it was a catastrophic fight but for iran it was the beginning of a threedecade project to build a shiite sphere of influence stretching across iraq and syria to the mediterranean along with its allies in syria and lebanon iran forms an axis of resistance arrayed against the region’s dominant sunni powers and the west in syria the project hung in the balance and suleimani was mounting a desperate fight even if the price of victory was a sectarian conflict that engulfed the region for years suleimani took command of the quds force fifteen years ago and in that time he has sought to reshape the middle east in iran’s favor working as a power broker and as a military force assassinating rivals arming allies and for most of a decade directing a network of militant groups that killed hundreds of americans in iraq the us department of the treasury has sanctioned suleimani for his role in supporting the assad regime and for abetting terrorism and yet he has remained mostly invisible to the outside world even as he runs agents and directs operations “suleimani is the single most powerful operative in the middle east today” john maguire a former cia officer in iraq told me “and no one’s ever heard of him” when suleimani appears in public—often to speak at veterans’ events or to meet with khamenei—he carries himself inconspicuously and rarely raises his voice exhibiting a trait that arabs call khilib or understated charisma “he is so short but he has this presence” a former senior iraqi official told me “there will be ten people in a room and when suleimani walks in he doesn’t come and sit with you he sits over there on the other side of room by himself in a very quiet way doesn’t speak doesn’t comment just sits and listens and so of course everyone is thinking only about him” at the funeral suleimani was dressed in a black jacket and a black shirt with no tie in the iranian style his long angular face and his arched eyebrows were twisted with pain the quds force had never lost such a highranking officer abroad the day before the funeral suleimani had travelled to shateri’s home to offer condolences to his family he has a fierce attachment to martyred soldiers and often visits their families in a recent interview with iranian media he said “when i see the children of the martyrs i want to smell their scent and i lose myself” as the funeral continued he and the other mourners bent forward to pray pressing their foreheads to the carpet “one of the rarest people who brought the revolution and the whole world to you is gone” alireza panahian the imam told the mourners suleimani cradled his head in his palm and began to weep the early months of 2013 around the time of shateri’s death marked a low point for the iranian intervention in syria assad was steadily losing ground to the rebels who are dominated by sunnis iran’s rivals if assad fell the iranian regime would lose its link to hezbollah its forward base against israel in a speech one iranian cleric said “if we lose syria we cannot keep tehran” although the iranians were severely strained by american sanctions imposed to stop the regime from developing a nuclear weapon they were unstinting in their efforts to save assad among other things they extended a sevenbilliondollar loan to shore up the syrian economy “i don’t think the iranians are calculating this in terms of dollars” a middle eastern security official told me “they regard the loss of assad as an existential threat” for suleimani saving assad seemed a matter of pride especially if it meant distinguishing himself from the americans “suleimani told us the iranians would do whatever was necessary” a former iraqi leader told me “he said ‘we’re not like the americans we don’t abandon our friends’ ” last year suleimani asked kurdish leaders in iraq to allow him to open a supply route across northern iraq and into syria for years he had bullied and bribed the kurds into coöperating with his plans but this time they rebuffed him worse assad’s soldiers wouldn’t fight—or when they did they mostly butchered civilians driving the populace to the rebels “the syrian army is useless” suleimani told an iraqi politician he longed for the basij the iranian militia whose fighters crushed the popular uprisings against the regime in 2009 “give me one brigade of the basij and i could conquer the whole country” he said in august 2012 antiassad rebels captured fortyeight iranians inside syria iranian leaders protested that they were pilgrims come to pray at a holy shiite shrine but the rebels as well as western intelligence agencies said that they were members of the quds force in any case they were valuable enough so that assad agreed to release more than two thousand captured rebels to have them freed and then shateri was killed finally suleimani began flying into damascus frequently so that he could assume personal control of the iranian intervention “he’s running the war himself” an american defense official told me in damascus he is said to work out of a heavily fortified command post in a nondescript building where he has installed a multinational array of officers the heads of the syrian military a hezbollah commander and a coördinator of iraqi shiite militias which suleimani mobilized and brought to the fight if suleimani couldn’t have the basij he settled for the next best thing brigadier general hossein hamedani the basij’s former deputy commander hamedani another comrade from the iraniraq war was experienced in running the kind of irregular militias that the iranians were assembling in order to keep on fighting if assad fell late last year western officials began to notice a sharp increase in iranian supply flights into the damascus airport instead of a handful a week planes were coming every day carrying weapons and ammunition—“tons of it” the middle eastern security official told me—along with officers from the quds force according to american officials the officers coördinated attacks trained militias and set up an elaborate system to monitor rebel communications they also forced the various branches of assad’s security services—designed to spy on one another—to work together the middle eastern security official said that the number of quds force operatives along with the iraqi shiite militiamen they brought with them reached into the thousands “they’re spread out across the entire country” he told me a turning point came in april after rebels captured the syrian town of qusayr near the lebanese border to retake the town suleimani called on hassan nasrallah hezbollah’s leader to send in more than two thousand fighters it wasn’t a difficult sell qusayr sits at the entrance to the bekaa valley the main conduit for missiles and other matériel to hezbollah if it was closed hezbollah would find it difficult to survive suleimani and nasrallah are old friends having coöperated for years in lebanon and in the many places around the world where hezbollah operatives have performed terrorist missions at the iranians’ behest according to will fulton an iran expert at the american enterprise institute hezbollah fighters encircled qusayr cutting off the roads then moved in dozens of them were killed as were at least eight iranian officers on june 5th the town fell “the whole operation was orchestrated by suleimani” maguire who is still active in the region said “it was a great victory for him” despite all of suleimani’s rough work his image among iran’s faithful is that of an irreproachable war hero—a decorated veteran of the iraniraq war in which he became a division commander while still in his twenties in public he is almost theatrically modest during a recent appearance he described himself as “the smallest soldier” and according to the iranian press rebuffed members of the audience who tried to kiss his hand his power comes mostly from his close relationship with khamenei who provides the guiding vision for iranian society the supreme leader who usually reserves his highest praise for fallen soldiers has referred to suleimani as “a living martyr of the revolution” suleimani is a hardline supporter of iran’s authoritarian system in july 1999 at the height of student protests he signed with other revolutionary guard commanders a letter warning the reformist president mohammad khatami that if he didn’t put down the revolt the military would—perhaps deposing khatami in the process “our patience has run out” the generals wrote the police crushed the demonstrators as they did again a decade later iran’s government is intensely fractious and there are many figures around khamenei who help shape foreign policy including revolutionary guard commanders senior clerics and foreign ministry officials but suleimani has been given a remarkably free hand in implementing khamenei’s vision “he has ties to every corner of the system” meir dagan the former head of mossad told me “he is what i call politically clever he has a relationship with everyone” officials describe him as a believer in islam and in the revolution while many senior figures in the revolutionary guard have grown wealthy through the guard’s control over key iranian industries suleimani has been endowed with a personal fortune by the supreme leader “he’s well taken care of” maguire said suleimani lives in tehran and appears to lead the home life of a bureaucrat in middle age “he gets up at four every morning and he’s in bed by ninethirty every night” the iraqi politician who has known him for many years told me shaking his head in disbelief suleimani has a bad prostate and recurring back pain he’s “respectful of his wife” the middle eastern security official told me sometimes taking her along on trips he has three sons and two daughters and is evidently a strict but loving father he is said to be especially worried about his daughter nargis who lives in malaysia “she is deviating from the ways of islam” the middle eastern official said maguire told me “suleimani is a far more polished guy than most he can move in political circles but he’s also got the substance to be intimidating” although he is widely read his aesthetic tastes appear to be strictly traditional “i don’t think he’d listen to classical music” the middle eastern official told me “the european thing—i don’t think that’s his vibe basically” suleimani has little formal education but the former senior iraqi official told me “he is a very shrewd frighteningly intelligent strategist” his tools include payoffs for politicians across the middle east intimidation when it is needed and murder as a last resort over the years the quds force has built an international network of assets some of them drawn from the iranian diaspora who can be called on to support missions “they’re everywhere” a second middle eastern security official said in 2010 according to western officials the quds force and hezbollah launched a new campaign against american and israeli targets—in apparent retaliation for the covert effort to slow down the iranian nuclear program which has included cyber attacks and assassinations of iranian nuclear scientists since then suleimani has orchestrated attacks in places as far flung as thailand new delhi lagos and nairobi—at least thirty attempts in the past two years alone the most notorious was a scheme in 2011 to hire a mexican drug cartel to blow up the saudi ambassador to the united states as he sat down to eat at a restaurant a few miles from the white house the cartel member approached by suleimani’s agent turned out to be an informant for the us drug enforcement administration the quds force appears to be more effective close to home and a number of the remote plans have gone awry still after the plot collapsed two former american officials told a congressional committee that suleimani should be assassinated “suleimani travels a lot” one said “he is all over the place go get him either try to capture him or kill him” in iran more than two hundred dignitaries signed an outraged letter in his defense a socialmedia campaign proclaimed “we are all qassem suleimani” several middle eastern officials some of whom i have known for a decade stopped talking the moment i brought up suleimani “we don’t want to have any part of this” a kurdish official in iraq said among spies in the west he appears to exist in a special category an enemy both hated and admired a middle eastern equivalent of karla the elusive soviet master spy in john le carré’s novels when i called dagan the former mossad chief and mentioned suleimani’s name there was a long pause on the line “ah” he said in a tone of weary irony “a very good friend” in march 2009 on the eve of the iranian new year suleimani led a group of iraniraq war veterans to the paaalam heights a barren rocky promontory on the iraqi border in 1986 paaalam was the scene of one of the terrible battles over the faw peninsula where tens of thousands of men died while hardly advancing a step a video recording from the visit shows suleimani standing on a mountaintop recounting the battle to his old comrades in a gentle voice he speaks over a soundtrack of music and prayers “this is the dashteabbas road” suleimani says pointing into the valley below “this area stood between us and the enemy” later suleimani and the group stand on the banks of a creek where he reads aloud the names of fallen iranian soldiers his voice trembling with emotion during a break he speaks with an interviewer and describes the fighting in nearmystical terms “the battlefield is mankind’s lost paradise—the paradise in which morality and human conduct are at their highest” he says “one type of paradise that men imagine is about streams beautiful maidens and lush landscape but there is another kind of paradise—the battlefield” suleimani was born in rabor an impoverished mountain village in eastern iran when he was a boy his father like many other farmers took out an agricultural loan from the government of the shah he owed nine hundred toman—about a hundred dollars at the time—and couldn’t pay it back in a brief memoir suleimani wrote of leaving home with a young relative named ahmad suleimani who was in a similar situation “at night we couldn’t fall asleep with the sadness of thinking that government agents were coming to arrest our fathers” he wrote together they travelled to kerman the nearest city to try to clear their family’s debt the place was unwelcoming “we were only thirteen and our bodies were so tiny wherever we went they wouldn’t hire us” he wrote “until one day when we were hired as laborers at a school construction site on khajoo street which was where the city ended they paid us two toman per day” after eight months they had saved enough money to bring home but the winter snow was too deep they were told to seek out a local driver named pahlavan—“champion”—who was a “strong man who could lift up a cow or a donkey with his teeth” during the drive whenever the car got stuck “he would lift up the jeep and put it aside” in suleimani’s telling pahlavan is an ardent detractor of the shah he says of the two boys “this is the time for them to rest and play not work as a laborer in a strange city i spit on the life they have made for us” they arrived home suleimani writes “just as the lights were coming on in the village homes when the news travelled in our village there was pandemonium” as a young man suleimani gave few signs of greater ambition according to ali alfoneh an iran expert at the foundation for defense of democracies he had only a highschool education and worked for kerman’s municipal water department but it was a revolutionary time and the country’s gathering unrest was making itself felt away from work suleimani spent hours lifting weights in local gyms which like many in the middle east offered physical training and inspiration for the warrior spirit during ramadan he attended sermons by a travelling preacher named hojjat kamyab—a protégé of khamenei’s—and it was there that he became inspired by the possibility of islamic revolution in 1979 when suleimani was twentytwo the shah fell to a popular uprising led by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in the name of islam swept up in the fervor suleimani joined the revolutionary guard a force established by iran’s new clerical leadership to prevent the military from mounting a coup though he received little training—perhaps only a fortyfiveday course—he advanced rapidly as a young guardsman suleimani was dispatched to northwestern iran where he helped crush an uprising by ethnic kurds when the revolution was eighteen months old saddam hussein sent the iraqi army sweeping across the border hoping to take advantage of the internal chaos instead the invasion solidified khomeini’s leadership and unified the country in resistance starting a brutal entrenched war suleimani was sent to the front with a simple task to supply water to the soldiers there and he never left “i entered the war on a fifteenday mission and ended up staying until the end” he has said a photograph from that time shows the young suleimani dressed in green fatigues with no insignia of rank his black eyes focussed on a far horizon “we were all young and wanted to serve the revolution” he told an interviewer in 2005 suleimani earned a reputation for bravery and élan especially as a result of reconnaissance missions he undertook behind iraqi lines he returned from several missions bearing a goat which his soldiers slaughtered and grilled “even the iraqis our enemy admired him for this” a former revolutionary guard officer who defected to the united states told me on iraqi radio suleimani became known as “the goat thief” in recognition of his effectiveness alfoneh said he was put in charge of a brigade from kerman with men from the gyms where he lifted weights the iranian army was badly overmatched and its commanders resorted to crude and costly tactics in “human wave” assaults they sent thousands of young men directly into the iraqi lines often to clear minefields and soldiers died at a precipitous rate suleimani seemed distressed by the loss of life before sending his men into battle he would embrace each one and bid him goodbye in speeches he praised martyred soldiers and begged their forgiveness for not being martyred himself when suleimani’s superiors announced plans to attack the faw peninsula he dismissed them as wasteful and foolhardy the former revolutionary guard officer recalled seeing suleimani in 1985 after a battle in which his brigade had suffered many dead and wounded he was sitting alone in a corner of a tent “he was very silent thinking about the people he’d lost” the officer said ahmad the young relative who travelled with suleimani to kerman was killed in 1984 on at least one occasion suleimani himself was wounded still he didn’t lose enthusiasm for his work in the nineteeneighties reuel marc gerecht was a young cia officer posted to istanbul where he recruited from the thousands of iranian soldiers who went there to recuperate “you’d get a whole variety of guardsmen” gerecht who has written extensively on iran told me “you’d get clerics you’d get people who came to breathe and whore and drink” gerecht divided the veterans into two groups “there were the broken and the burned out the holloweyed—the guys who had been destroyed” he said “and then there were the brighteyed guys who just couldn’t wait to get back to the front i’d put suleimani in the latter category” ryan crocker the american ambassador to iraq from 2007 to 2009 got a similar feeling during the iraq war crocker sometimes dealt with suleimani indirectly through iraqi leaders who shuttled in and out of tehran once he asked one of the iraqis if suleimani was especially religious the answer was “not really” crocker told me “he attends mosque periodically religion doesn’t drive him nationalism drives him and the love of the fight” iran’s leaders took two lessons from the iraniraq war the first was that iran was surrounded by enemies near and far to the regime the invasion was not so much an iraqi plot as a western one american officials were aware of saddam’s preparations to invade iran in 1980 and they later provided him with targeting information used in chemicalweapons attacks the weapons themselves were built with the help of western european firms the memory of these attacks is an especially bitter one “do you know how many people are still suffering from the effects of chemical weapons” mehdi khalaji a fellow at the washington institute for near east policy said “thousands of former soldiers they believe these were western weapons given to saddam” in 1987 during a battle with the iraqi army a division under suleimani’s command was attacked by artillery shells containing chemical weapons more than a hundred of his men suffered the effects the other lesson drawn from the iraniraq war was the futility of fighting a headtohead confrontation in 1982 after the iranians expelled the iraqi forces khomeini ordered his men to keep going to “liberate” iraq and push on to jerusalem six years and hundreds of thousands of lives later he agreed to a ceasefire according to alfoneh many of the generals of suleimani’s generation believe they could have succeeded had the clerics not flinched “many of them feel like they were stabbed in the back” he said “they have nurtured this myth for nearly thirty years” but iran’s leaders did not want another bloodbath instead they had to build the capacity to wage asymmetrical warfare—attacking stronger powers indirectly outside of iran the quds force was an ideal tool khomeini had created the prototype for the force in 1979 with the goal of protecting iran and exporting the islamic revolution the first big opportunity came in lebanon where revolutionary guard officers were dispatched in 1982 to help organize shiite militias in the manysided lebanese civil war those efforts resulted in the creation of hezbollah which developed under iranian guidance hezbollah’s military commander the brilliant and murderous imad mughniyeh helped form what became known as the special security apparatus a wing of hezbollah that works closely with the quds force with assistance from iran hezbollah helped orchestrate attacks on the american embassy and on french and american military barracks “in the early days when hezbollah was totally dependent on iranian help mughniyeh and others were basically willing iranian assets” david crist a historian for the us military and the author of “the twilight war” says for all of the iranian regime’s aggressiveness some of its religious zeal seemed to burn out in 1989 khomeini stopped urging iranians to spread the revolution and called instead for expediency to preserve its gains persian selfinterest was the order of the day even if it was indistinguishable from revolutionary fervor in those years suleimani worked along iran’s eastern frontier aiding afghan rebels who were holding out against the taliban the iranian regime regarded the taliban with intense hostility in large part because of their persecution of afghanistan’s minority shiite population at one point the two countries nearly went to war iran mobilized a quarter of a million troops and its leaders denounced the taliban as an affront to islam in an area that breeds corruption suleimani made a name for himself battling opium smugglers along the afghan border in 1998 suleimani was named the head of the quds force taking over an agency that had already built a lethal résumé american and argentine officials believe that the iranian regime helped hezbollah orchestrate the bombing of the israeli embassy in buenos aires in 1992 which killed twentynine people and the attack on the jewish center in the same city two years later which killed eightyfive suleimani has built the quds force into an organization with extraordinary reach with branches focussed on intelligence finance politics sabotage and special operations with a base in the former us embassy compound in tehran the force has between ten thousand and twenty thousand members divided between combatants and those who train and oversee foreign assets its members are picked for their skill and their allegiance to the doctrine of the islamic revolution as well as in some cases their family connections according to the israeli newspaper israel hayom fighters are recruited throughout the region trained in shiraz and tehran indoctrinated at the jerusalem operation college in qom and then “sent on monthslong missions to afghanistan and iraq to gain experience in field operational work they usually travel under the guise of iranian construction workers” after taking command suleimani strengthened relationships in lebanon with mughniyeh and with hassan nasrallah hezbollah’s chief by then the israeli military had occupied southern lebanon for sixteen years and hezbollah was eager to take control of the country so suleimani sent in quds force operatives to help “they had a huge presence—training advising planning” crocker said in 2000 the israelis withdrew exhausted by relentless hezbollah attacks it was a signal victory for the shiites and crocker said “another example of how countries like syria and iran can play a long game knowing that we can’t” since then the regime has given aid to a variety of militant islamist groups opposed to america’s allies in the region such as saudi arabia and bahrain the help has gone not only to shiites but also to sunni groups like hamas—helping to form an archipelago of alliances that stretches from baghdad to beirut “no one in tehran started out with a master plan to build the axis of resistance but opportunities presented themselves” a western diplomat in baghdad told me “in each case suleimani was smarter faster and better resourced than anyone else in the region by grasping at opportunities as they came he built the thing slowly but surely” in the chaotic days after the attacks of september 11th ryan crocker then a senior state department official flew discreetly to geneva to meet a group of iranian diplomats “i’d fly out on a friday and then back on sunday so nobody in the office knew where i’d been” crocker told me “we’d stay up all night in those meetings” it seemed clear to crocker that the iranians were answering to suleimani whom they referred to as “haji qassem” and that they were eager to help the united states destroy their mutual enemy the taliban although the united states and iran broke off diplomatic relations in 1980 after american diplomats in tehran were taken hostage crocker wasn’t surprised to find that suleimani was flexible “you don’t live through eight years of brutal war without being pretty pragmatic” he said sometimes suleimani passed messages to crocker but he avoided putting anything in writing “haji qassem’s way too smart for that” crocker said “he’s not going to leave paper trails for the americans” before the bombing began crocker sensed that the iranians were growing impatient with the bush administration thinking that it was taking too long to attack the taliban at a meeting in early october 2001 the lead iranian negotiator stood up and slammed a sheaf of papers on the table “if you guys don’t stop building these fairytale governments in the sky and actually start doing some shooting on the ground none of this is ever going to happen” he shouted “when you’re ready to talk about serious fighting you know where to find me” he stomped out of the room “it was a great moment” crocker said the coöperation between the two countries lasted through the initial phase of the war at one point the lead negotiator handed crocker a map detailing the disposition of taliban forces “here’s our advice hit them here first and then hit them over here and here’s the logic” stunned crocker asked “can i take notes” the negotiator replied “you can keep the map” the flow of information went both ways on one occasion crocker said he gave his counterparts the location of an al qaeda facilitator living in the eastern city of mashhad the iranians detained him and brought him to afghanistan’s new leaders who crocker believes turned him over to the us the negotiator told crocker “haji qassem is very pleased with our coöperation” the good will didn’t last in january 2002 crocker who was by then the deputy chief of the american embassy in kabul was awakened one night by aides who told him that president george w bush in his state of the union address had named iran as part of an “axis of evil” like many senior diplomats crocker was caught off guard he saw the negotiator the next day at the un compound in kabul and he was furious “you completely damaged me” crocker recalled him saying “suleimani is in a tearing rage he feels compromised” the negotiator told crocker that at great political risk suleimani had been contemplating a complete reëvaluation of the united states saying “maybe it’s time to rethink our relationship with the americans” the axis of evil speech brought the meetings to an end reformers inside the government who had advocated a rapprochement with the united states were put on the defensive recalling that time crocker shook his head “we were just that close” he said “one word in one speech changed history” before the meetings fell apart crocker talked with the lead negotiator about the possibility of war in iraq “look” crocker said “i don’t know what’s going to happen but i do have some responsibility for iraq—it’s my portfolio—and i can read the signs and i think we’re going to go in” he saw an enormous opportunity the iranians despised saddam and crocker figured that they would be willing to work with the us “i was not a fan of the invasion” he told me “but i was thinking if we’re going to do it let’s see if we can flip an enemy into a friend—at least tactically for this and then let’s see where we can take it” the negotiator indicated that the iranians were willing to talk and that iraq like afghanistan was part of suleimani’s brief “it’s one guy running both shows” after the invasion began in march 2003 iranian officials were frantic to let the americans know that they wanted peace many of them watched the regimes topple in afghanistan and iraq and were convinced that they were next “they were scared shitless” maguire the former cia officer in baghdad told me “they were sending runners across the border to our élite elements saying ‘look we don’t want any trouble with you’ we had an enormous upper hand” that same year american officials determined that iran had reconfigured its plans to develop a nuclear weapon to proceed more slowly and covertly lest it invite a western attack after saddam’s regime collapsed crocker was dispatched to baghdad to organize a fledgling government called the iraqi governing council he realized that many iraqi politicians were flying to tehran for consultations and he jumped at the chance to negotiate indirectly with suleimani in the course of the summer crocker passed him the names of prospective shiite candidates and the two men vetted each one crocker did not offer veto power but he abandoned candidates whom suleimani found especially objectionable “the formation of the governing council was in its essence a negotiation between tehran and washington” he said that exchange was the high point of iranianamerican coöperation “after we formed the governing council everything collapsed” crocker said as the american occupation faltered suleimani began an aggressive campaign of sabotage many americans and iraqis i interviewed thought that the change of strategy was the result of opportunism the iranians became aggressive when the fear of an american invasion began to recede for years suleimani had sent operatives into iraq to cultivate shiite militias so when saddam fell he already had a fighting force in place the badr brigade the armed wing of a shiite political party called the supreme council for the islamic revolution in iraq the party’s leaders so thoroughly identified with the iranian revolution that badr’s militiamen had fought alongside iranian forces in the iraniraq war the badr brigade spent much of its time carrying out revenge killings against baathists and largely held its fire against the americans but another iranianbacked militia—the mahdi army headed by the populist cleric moqtada alsadr—began confronting the americans early in august 2004 after the americans launched a particularly bloody counteroffensive i walked through a makeshift graveyard in the holy city of najaf south of baghdad and found dozens of shallow graves each marked by a tiny glass jar containing a slip of paper with the fallen fighter’s name and address many of them were marked “tehran” suleimani found sadr unpredictable and difficult to manage so the quds force began to organize other militias that were willing to attack the americans its operatives trained fighters in iran sometimes helped by their comrades in hezbollah suleimani’s control over some of the iraqi militias at times appeared to be total at one point a senior iraqi official on a trip to washington publicly blamed the supreme leader for escalating the violence in iraq soon after returning to baghdad he told me he received messages from the leaders of two iraqi shiite militias both posed the same question do you want to die in 2004 the quds force began flooding iraq with lethal roadside bombs that the americans referred to as efps for “explosively formed projectiles” the efps which fire a molten copper slug able to penetrate armor began to wreak havoc on american troops accounting for nearly twenty per cent of combat deaths efps could be made only by skilled technicians and they were often triggered by sophisticated motion sensors “there was zero question where they were coming from” general stanley mcchrystal who at the time was the head of the joint special operations command told me “we knew where all the factories were in iran the efps killed hundreds of americans” suleimani’s campaign against the united states crossed the sunnishiite divide which he has always been willing to set aside for a larger purpose iraqi and western officials told me that early in the war suleimani encouraged the head of intelligence for the assad regime to facilitate the movement of sunni extremists through syria to fight the americans in many cases al qaeda was also allowed a degree of freedom in iran as well crocker told me that in may 2003 the americans received intelligence that al qaeda fighters in iran were preparing an attack on western targets in saudi arabia crocker was alarmed “they were there under iranian protection planning operations” he said he flew to geneva and passed a warning to the iranians but to no avail militants bombed three residential compounds in riyadh killing thirtyfive people including nine americans as it turned out the iranian strategy of abetting sunni extremists backfired horrendously shortly after the occupation began the same extremists began attacking shiite civilians and the shiitedominated iraqi government it was a preview of the civil war to come “welcome to the middle east” the western diplomat in baghdad told me “suleimani wanted to bleed the americans so he invited in the jihadis and things got out of control” still iran’s policy toward the americans in iraq was not entirely hostile—both countries after all were trying to empower iraq’s shiite majority—and so suleimani alternated between bargaining with the americans and killing them throughout the war he summoned iraqi leaders to tehran to broker deals usually intended to maximize shiite power at least once he even travelled into the heart of american power in baghdad “suleimani came into the green zone to meet the iraqis” the iraqi politician told me “i think the americans wanted to arrest him but they figured they couldn’t” as both sides sought an advantage the shifting allegiances led to uncomfortable sometimes bizarre encounters the leaders of the two main kurdish parties massoud barzani and jalal talabani met regularly with both suleimani and the americans while the kurds’ relationship with the us was usually warm their ties to iranian leaders like suleimani were deeper and more complex the iranian regime had sheltered iraq’s kurds during their war with saddam but it was never an equal relationship kurdish leaders say that suleimani’s objective has always been to keep iraq’s political parties divided and unstable insuring that the country stayed weak the iraniraq war was never far from his mind “it is very difficult for us to say no to suleimani” a senior kurdish official told me “when we say no he makes trouble for us bombings shootings the iranians are our neighbors they’ve always been there and they always will be we have to deal with them” a senior intelligence officer in baghdad recalled visiting talabani at his house during a trip to northern iraq when he walked in qassem suleimani was sitting there wearing a black shirt and black jacket the two men looked each other up and down “he knew who i was i knew who he was we shook hands didn’t say anything” the officer said “i’ve never seen talabani so deferential to anyone he was terrified” in the years after the invasion general mcchrystal concentrated on defeating sunni insurgents and like other american commanders in iraq he largely refrained from pursuing quds force agents provoking iran would only exacerbate the conflict and in any case many of the agents operated under the protection of diplomatic cover but as the war dragged on the iranianbacked militias loomed ever larger in late 2006 mcchrystal told me he formed a task force to kill and capture iranianbacked insurgents as well as quds force operatives that december american commandos raided the compound of abdul aziz alhakim a powerful shiite politician and found general mohsen chizari the head of operations for the quds force according to “the endgame” by michael gordon and bernard trainor the commandos detained chizari sending shock waves through baghdad “everybody was stunned” a former senior military commander told me “all the iranians were stunned we had broken the unwritten law” nuri almaliki the iraqi prime minister demanded that the americans turn over chizari when they did—reluctantly—maliki released him after the incident the american ambassador told maliki that the next time they caught an iranian operative they were going to keep him a month later mcchrystal received reports that general mohammed ali jafari the head of iran’s revolutionary guard might be in a convoy heading toward the iraqi border according to other intelligence sources suleimani was riding with him a group of kurdish fighters were waiting to welcome them when they crossed over mcchrystal decided to allow the iranians to cross the border “we didn’t want to get into a gunfight with the kurds” he said mcchrystal’s men tracked the convoy as it drove a hundred miles into iraq to the kurdish city of erbil and stopped at a nondescript building which had a small sign that read “consulate” no one knew that such a consulate existed but the fact that it did meant that the men inside were operating under diplomatic cover the americans moved in anyway and took five iranians into custody all were carrying diplomatic passports and all according to mcchrystal were quds force members neither suleimani nor jafari was there they had evidently broken off from the convoy at the last minute and taken refuge in a safe house controlled by the kurdish leader massoud barzani “suleimani was lucky” dagan the former mossad chief told me referring to the raid “it’s important to be lucky” nine days later five new black suvs pulled up to the gates of the karbala provincial center in southern iraq the men inside spoke english wore americanstyle uniforms and flashed ids and so they were allowed through the gates in the compound they jumped out of their vehicles and ran directly to a building where american soldiers were working they killed one and captured four ignoring everyone else in a few hours the four captives were dead shot at close range the raid was carried out by asa’ib ahl alhaq one of the iranianbacked militias american officials speculated that suleimani had ordered the raid in response to the capture of the quds force operatives in erbil within two months the americans had killed the alleged leader of the attack and rounded up several of the participants one of them was ali musa daqduq a hezbollah commander who had trained in iran at first daqduq pretended to be unable to speak and the americans nicknamed him hamid the mute but after a time they said he started talking and told them that the operation had been ordered by iranian officials for the first time american commanders publicly pointed to suleimani at a press conference brigadier general kevin bergner said “the quds force knew of and supported planning for the eventual karbala attack that killed five coalition soldiers” as the covert war with iran intensified american officials considered crossing into iran to attack training camps and bomb factories “some of us wanted very badly to hit them” a senior american officer who was in iraq at the time told me those debates lasted well into 2011 until the last american soldiers left the country each time the americans decided against crossing the border figuring that it would be too easy for the iranians to escalate the fighting around the same time suleimani struck up a correspondence with senior american officials sending messages through intermediaries—sometimes seeking to reassure the americans sometimes to extract something one of the first came in early 2008 when the iraqi president jalal talabani handed a cell phone with a text message to general david petraeus who had taken over the year before as the commander of american forces “dear general petraeus” the text read “you should know that i qassem suleimani control the policy for iran with respect to iraq lebanon gaza and afghanistan and indeed the ambassador in baghdad is a quds force member the individual who’s going to replace him is a quds force member” after the five american soldiers were killed in karbala suleimani sent a message to the american ambassador “i swear on the grave of khomeini i haven’t authorized a bullet against the us” suleimani said none of the americans believed him in a report to the white house petraeus wrote that suleimani was “truly evil” yet at times the two men were all but negotiating according to diplomatic cables revealed by wikileaks petraeus sent messages through iraqi officials to suleimani asking him to call off rocket attacks on the american embassy and on us bases in 2008 the americans and the iraqi army were pressing an offensive against the mahdi army—moqtada alsadr’s shiite militia—and in retribution the militia was bombarding the green zone regularly suleimani who sensed a political opening sent petraeus a message lamenting the situation and saying that he had assigned men to apprehend the attackers petraeus replied “i was born on a sunday but it wasn’t last sunday” eventually suleimani brokered a ceasefire between sadr and the government at times suleimani seemed to take pleasure in taunting his american counterparts and stories of his exploits spread in the summer of 2006 during the thirtyfourday war between israel and hezbollah in lebanon the violence in baghdad appeared to ebb when the fighting ended the iraqi politician told me suleimani supposedly sent a message to the american command “i hope you have been enjoying the peace and quiet in baghdad” it read “i’ve been busy in beirut” in a speech in 1990 khamenei said that the mission of the quds force is to “establish popular hezbollah cells all over the world” although that goal has not been met hezbollah has become the most influential force in lebanon—a military power and a political party that nearly supersedes the state some experts on the region believe that it has grown less dependent on iran as it has matured but at a dinner in beirut last year walid joumblatt a lebanese politician complained that hezbollah’s leaders were still in thrall to tehran “you have to sit and talk with them but what do you say” he said to me “they don’t decide it’s khamenei and qassem suleimani who decide” hezbollah’s leader hassan nasrallah has endorsed the concept of velayate faqih which recognizes iran’s supreme leader as the ultimate authority and he has acknowledged the presence of quds force operatives in lebanon from 2000 to 2006 iran contributed a hundred million dollars a year to hezbollah its fighters are attractive proxies unlike the iranians they speak arabic making them better equipped to operate in syria and elsewhere in the arab world working with the iranians they have either launched or prepared to launch attacks in cyprus azerbaijan and turkey they don’t always act together after a hezbollah operative attacked a tour bus filled with israelis in bulgaria last july american authorities learned that suleimani had asked his subordinates “does anyone know about this” no one did “hezbollah acted on its own in that one” an american defense official told me nonetheless the quds force appears to have been involved in a number of the most significant moments in lebanon’s recent history in 2006 nasrallah ordered a group of his fighters to kidnap israeli soldiers—an operation that the middle eastern security official told me was carried out with suleimani’s help a brief but fierce war ensued in which the israel defense forces destroyed much of lebanon “i don’t think suleimani expected that reaction” the official said the question of iranian influence in lebanon resurfaced in 2011 when the united nationsbacked special tribunal for lebanon charged four senior members of hezbollah with assassinating the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri in 2005 hariri a sunni had been trying to take lebanon out of the iraniansyrian orbit on valentine’s day he was killed by a suicide truck bomb whose payload weighed more than five thousand pounds prosecutors identified the alleged hezbollah assassins by means of “colocation analysis”—matching disposable cell phones used at the time of the murder with other phones that belonged to the suspects they refrained from indicting syrian officials but they said they had convincing evidence that assad’s government was involved in hariri’s killing a senior investigator for the special tribunal told me that there was also reason to suspect the iranians “our theory of the case was that hezbollah pulled the trigger but could not and would not have done so without the blessing and logistical support from both syria and iran” one of the phones believed to have been used by the killers had made at least a dozen calls to iran before and after the assassination but investigators told me that they didn’t know who in iran was called and that they couldn’t persuade western intelligence agencies to help them as it turned out the agencies knew quite a bit the senior intelligence officer told me that iranian operatives were overheard talking minutes before the assassination “there were iranians on the phones directing the attack” he said robert baer a former senior cia official told me “if indeed iran was involved suleimani was undoubtedly at the center of this” meanwhile the four hezbollah suspects in the killing have disappeared one of them mustafa badreddine—imad mughniyeh’s brotherinlaw and a longtime hezbollah bomb maker—was spotted in syria by the rebels who say that he is fighting for assad on december 22 2010 james jeffrey the american ambassador to iraq and general lloyd austin the top american commander there issued a note of congratulations to the iraqi people on the formation of a new government led by prime minister nuri almaliki the country had been without a government for nine months after parliamentary elections ended in an impasse the composition of the government was critical at the time of the election there were still nearly a hundred thousand american troops in the country and us commanders were still hoping to leave a residual force behind “we look forward to working with the new coalition government in furthering our common vision of a democratic iraq” the two men said what jeffrey and austin didn’t say was that the crucial deal that brought the iraqi government together was made not by them but by suleimani in the months before according to several iraqi and western officials suleimani invited senior shiite and kurdish leaders to meet with him in tehran and qom and extracted from them a promise to support maliki his preferred candidate the deal had a complex array of enticements maliki and assad disliked each other suleimani brought them together by forging an agreement to build a lucrative oil pipeline from iraq to the syrian border in order to bring the cleric moqtada alsadr in line suleimani agreed to place his men in the iraqi service ministries most remarkable according to the iraqi and western officials were the two conditions that suleimani imposed on the iraqis the first was that jalal talabani a longtime friend of the iranian regime become president the second was that maliki and his coalition partners insist that all american troops leave the country “suleimani said no americans” the former iraqi leader told me “a tenyear relationship down the drain” iraqi officials told me that at the time of jeffrey’s announcement the americans knew that suleimani had pushed them out of the country but were too embarrassed to admit it in public “we were laughing at the americans” the former iraqi leader told me growing angry as he recalled the situation “fuck it fuck it” he said “suleimani completely outmaneuvered them and in public they were congratulating themselves for putting the government together” the deal was a heavy blow to ayad allawi a proamerican secular politician whose party had won the most parliamentary seats in the elections but who failed to put together a majority coalition in an interview in jordan he said that with us backing he could have built a majority instead the americans pushed him aside in favor of maliki he told me that vicepresident joe biden called to tell him to abandon his bid for prime minister saying “you can’t form a government” allawi said he suspected that the americans weren’t willing to deal with the trouble the iranians would have made if he had become prime minister they wanted to stay in iraq he said but only if the effort involved was minimal “i needed american support” he said “but they wanted to leave and they handed the country to the iranians iraq is a failed state now an iranian colony” according to american and iraqi former officials suleimani exerts leverage over iraqi politics by paying officials by subsidizing newspapers and television stations and when necessary by intimidation few are immune to his enticements “i have yet to see one shia political party not taking money from qassem suleimani” the former senior iraqi official told me “he’s the most powerful man in iraq without question” even maliki often feels like a prisoner of the iranians exiled by saddam maliki lived for a short time in iran but then moved to syria—in part to escape iranian influence iraqis who know him say crocker said that maliki once told him “you can’t know what arrogance is until you are an iraqi arab forced to take refuge with the iranians” the iraqi politician who is close to both men told me that maliki resents suleimani and that the feeling is mutual “maliki says suleimani doesn’t listen” he told me “suleimani says maliki just lies” still maliki may be amply repaying suleimani for his efforts to make him prime minister according to the former senior intelligence officer maliki’s government is presiding over a number of schemes amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars a year to help the iranian regime outwit western economic sanctions a prominent iraqi businessman told me that iranianbacked agents regularly use the iraqi banking system to undertake fraudulent transactions that allow them to sell iraqi currency at a huge profit “if the banks refuse they are shut down by the government” he said the other main source of revenue for the iranians is oil officials say maliki’s government sets aside the equivalent of two hundred thousand barrels of oil a day—about twenty million dollars’ worth at current prices—and sends the money to suleimani in this way the quds force has made itself immune to the economic pressures of western sanctions “it’s a selffunding covertaction program” the former senior intelligence officer said “suleimani doesn’t even need the iranian budget to fund his operations” last december when assad’s regime appeared close to collapse american officials spotted syrian technicians preparing bombs carrying the nerve agent sarin to be loaded onto aircraft all indications were that they were plotting an enormous chemical attack frantic the americans called leaders in russia who called their counterparts in tehran according to the american defense official suleimani appeared to be instrumental in persuading assad to refrain from using the weapons suleimani’s sentiments about the ethics of chemical weapons are unknown during the iraniraq war thousands of iranian soldiers suffered from chemical attacks and the survivors still speak publicly of the trauma but some american officials believe that his efforts to restrain assad had a more pragmatic inspiration the fear of provoking american military intervention “both the russians and the iranians have said to assad ‘we can’t support you in the court of world opinion if you use this stuff’ ” a former senior american military official said the regime is believed to have used chemical weapons at least fourteen times since last year yet even after the enormous sarin attack on august 21st which killed fourteen hundred civilians suleimani’s support for syria has been unbending to save assad suleimani has called on every asset he built since taking over the quds force hezbollah fighters shiite militiamen from around the arab world and all the money and matériel he could squeeze out of his own besieged government in baghdad a young iraqi shiite who called himself abu hassan told me that he was recruited to fight by a group of iraqi men he took a bus to the iranian city of mashhad where he and three dozen other iraqis received two weeks of instruction from iranian trainers the men travelled to the shiite shrine of sayyidah zaynab near damascus where they spent three months fighting for the assad government along with soldiers from hezbollah and snipers from iran “we lost a lot of people” abu hassan told me suleimani’s greatest achievement may be persuading his proxies in the iraqi government to allow iran to use its airspace to fly men and munitions to damascus general james mattis who until march was the commander of all american military forces in the middle east told me that without this aid the assad regime would have collapsed months ago the flights are overseen by the iraqi transportation minister hadi alamri who is an old ally of suleimani’s—the former head of the badr brigade and a soldier on the iranian side in the iraniraq war in an interview in baghdad amri denied that the iranians were using iraqi airspace to send weapons but he made clear his affection for his former commander “i love qassem suleimani” he said pounding the table “he is my dearest friend” so far maliki has resisted pressure to supply assad overland through iraq but he hasn’t stopped the flights the prospect of a radical sunni regime in syria overcame his reservations about becoming involved in a civil war “maliki dislikes the iranians and he loathes assad but he hates al nusra” crocker told me “he doesn’t want an al qaeda government in damascus” this kind of starkly sectarian atmosphere may be suleimani’s most lasting impact on the middle east to save his iranian empire in syria and lebanon he has helped fuel a sunnishiite conflict that threatens to engulf the region for years to come—a war that he appears happy to wage “he has every reason to believe that iran is the rising power in the region” mattis told me “we’ve never dealt him a body blow” in june a new moderate president hassan rouhani was elected in iran promising to end the sanctions which have exhausted the country and demolished its middle class hopes have risen in the west that khamenei might allow rouhani to strike a deal although rouhani is a moderate only by iranian standards—he is a shiite cleric and a longtime adherent of the revolution—his new administration has made a series of goodwill gestures including the release of eleven political prisoners and an exchange of letters with president obama rouhani is in new york this week to speak at the united nations and possibly to meet with obama the talks will surely center on the potential for iran to restrain its nuclear program in exchange for relaxed sanctions many in the west are hoping that iran will also help find an end to the grinding war in syria assad’s deputy prime minister recently offered the possibility of a ceasefire saying “let nobody have any fear that the regime in its present form will continue” but he did not say that assad would step down which the rebels have said is a necessary condition of negotiations there have been hints from powerful iranians that assad isn’t worth holding on to in a recent speech the former president hashemi rafsanjani said “the people have been the target of chemical attacks by their own government” after a leaked recording of the speech caused a stir in iran rafsanjani denied the remarks but a less sympathetic regime in syria would split the axis of resistance and radically complicate iran’s partnership with hezbollah in any case the iranian regime may be too fragmented to come to a consensus “anytime you see a statement coming out of the government just remember there’s a rat’s nest of people fighting underneath the surface” kevan harris a sociologist at princeton who has studied iran extensively told me as rouhani tries to engage the west he will have to contend with the hardliners including suleimani and his comrades who for more than a decade have defined their foreign policy as a covert war on the us and israel “they don’t trust the other side” harris said “they feel that any concession they make will be seen by the west as a sign of weakness” for suleimani giving up assad would mean abandoning the project of expansion that has occupied him for fifteen years in a recent speech before the assembly of experts—the clerics who choose the supreme leader—he spoke about syria in fiercely determined language “we do not pay attention to the propaganda of the enemy because syria is the front line of the resistance and this reality is undeniable’’ he said “we have a duty to defend muslims because they are under pressure and oppression” suleimani was fighting the same war against the same foes that he’d been fighting his entire life for him it seemed the compromises of statecraft could not compare with the paradise of the battlefield “we will support syria to the end” he said ♦ will be used in accordance with our

75,warfaretoday at the heart of the fighting they have been described as a greater threat than islamic extremists boko haram but until recently little international attention has been paid to the islamic state in west africa iswa now they control huge swathes of territory in the lake chad region  one problem in identify this new islamic terrorism threat has been agreeing on the name of the organization the islamic state in west africa is also known as isiswest africa isiswa also known as isis west africa also known as isis west africa province also known as islamic state of iraq and syria west africa province also known as islamic state of iraq and the levantwest africa isilwa also known as islamic state west africa province iswap according to other sources boko haram is simply the common name used for the islamic state in west africa but according to new analysis they would appear to be a different group unlike boko haram the islamic state in west africa iswa is on a mission to win over the local people where boko haram has won a reputation for savagery iswa is digging wells giving out seeds and fertilizer and providing safe pasture for herders in the lake chad basin the islamic state in west africa iswa split from nigeria’s boko haram in 2016 and has been rapidly gaining ground with its “hearts and minds” strategy one local man told reuters that “if you are a herder driver or trader they won’t touch you — just follow their rules and regulations governing the territory they don’t touch civilians just security personnel” this strategy has created a taxable economy for iswa supporting its wider campaign to bring territory in northeastern nigeria and in niger under islamic control officials have tried to downplay the threat but new findings show that iswa stretches farther and is more entrenched than they have previously acknowledged for the first time provided detailshave been forthcoming of the islamic group’s growing efforts to establish a form of administration in the lake chad area from witnesses people familiar with the insurgency researchers and western diplomats a map produced by the us development agency in february shows iswa territory extending more than 100 miles into the northeastern nigerian states of borno and yobe where government has in many areas all but vanished after a decade of conflict the islamists have not been defeated as nigeria says and researchers say iswa less brutal than boko haram has evolved into the dominant group the us map paints a similar picture with iswa operating in much of borno “islamic state has a terrible reputation for being so brutal around the world and people can’t imagine an islamic state faction could be more moderate than boko haram” said jacob zenn of the jamestown foundation in washington dc analysts estimate that iswa has 30005000 fighters roughly double boko haram’s strength the lake chad countries — nigeria niger chad and cameroon — have long neglected the region allowing iswa to create a stronghold from which to launch attacks its gains contrast with setbacks for islamic state in syria and iraq vincent foucher who studies boko haram at the french national centre for science research said it makes sense for iswa to organize the local economy and raise taxes it opens the longer game of trying to create a connection to people he thought that if iswa succeeds then it may become a greater threat than boko haram nigeria’s president muhammadu buhari pledged to finish off boko haram in 2015 and officials maintain this has been achieved the conflict however continues and is now into its tenth year a presidency spokesman declined to comment for this story the complexity of the regional situation and possibly confusion over the name meant that it was not until 2018 that the usa officially declared iswa a terrorist group us secretary of state rex tillerson signed a public notice to the effect that the islamic state in west africa was a designated foreign terrorist organization the office of the federal registrar has published this based upon a review of the administrative record assembled in this matter and in consultation with the attorney general and the secretary of the treasury i conclude that there is a sufficient factual basis to find that the relevant circumstances described in section 219 of the immigration and nationality act as amended hereinafter “ina” 8 usc 1189 exist with respect to isiswest africa isiswa also known as isis west africa also known as isis west africa province also known as islamic state of iraq and syria west africa province also known as islamic state of iraq and the levantwest africa isilwa also known as islamic state west africa province iswap therefore i hereby designate the aforementioned organization and its aliases as a foreign terrorist organization pursuant to section 219 of the ina ​a large number of aliases had to be admitted into the document inexplicably the specific wording “islamic state in west africa” was not among them but iswa’s territory is not completely secure the nigerian air force often bombs and troops from lake chad countries attack the insurgents’ domain around its shores and islands nigeria’s armed forces “just see them as boko haram” said brigadier general john agim spokesman for the nigerian military at a briefing “we are not interested in the faction what has that got to do with it” “they are not a government they kidnap girls from schools” agim told reuters in a separate interview the military has announced an operation “to totally destroy boko haram locations in the lake chad basin” — iswa’s domain — and end the insurgency within four months maiduguri is the biggest city in nigeria’s northeast the center of the military’s fight against boko haram but rural areas largely remain nogo zones for the authorities it is there that iswa is making its mark offering people protection particularly from boko haram iswa has so far proved intractable in its lake chad bases where troops have been unable to make effective inroads according to a western diplomat who follows the group the nigerian military had “completely lost the initiative against the insurgency” they said the diplomat said iswa was ready to cede less important areas because the military cannot hold them “however they maintain absolute control over the islands and immediate areas near them where they train live etc” the us british and french militaries are helping regional governments with intelligence and training western officials declined or did not respond to requests for comment iswa protects locals from boko haram something nigeria’s army cannot always do that according to one of the people with knowledge of the insurgency has won the group local backing and eroded support for the military iswa is led by abu musab albarnawi the son of boko haram’s founder muhammed yusuf who was killed by police in 2009 after yusuf’s death his deputy abubakar shekau took control of boko haram and continues to lead it until the present day it is estimated that the islamic insurgency in nigeria has led to the deaths of more than 34000 people according to the armed conflict location  event data project in contrast to usual isis tactics iswa’s leaders keep a low profile they do not appear in videos or claim responsibility for attacks it has been suggested that this to avoid the attention of both regional governments and international media reuters for example was unable to contact the group for comment this contrasts with the wholesale violence of boko haram under the publicityhungry abubakar shekau who has even executed close lieutenants his group has strapped suicide bombs to women and children to attack civilians in mosques markets and refugee camps boko haram and iswa are bloody rivals but some travelers in iswa territory feel safer than elsewhere in nigeria’s northeast the herders said iswa provides safe grazing for about 2500 naira 8 a cow and 1500 naira 5 for smaller animals iswa also runs slaughterhouses for the cattle taking a cut for each animal as well as from other activities like gathering firewood “albarnawi is sending people into idp internally displaced persons camps to encourage people to return and farm and the people are” said a person with knowledge of iswa’s activities “they iswa are friendly and nice to those who come to the area while they indoctrinate other people and sometimes they bring motorcycles for those who want to join them” a charcoal maker said nigeria’s military plays into the insurgents’ hands by shutting down markets to deny supplies to the group while iswa encourages business “they have checkpoints for stop and search and if you are a regular visitor they know you” said a another herder adding that iswa has spies everywhere including informers who alert them to military attacks he described seeing islamic state’s black flags and said preachers were used to win people over under iswa men must wear long beards nighttime movements are restricted and prayers are compulsory the herder said offenders can get 40 lashes despite its name experts believe that iswa’s ties to islamic state in the middle east while theologically strong are tactically loose “what’s clear from iswa primary source documents is that iswa has asked is for theological guidance on who it is lawful to attack” said zenn daily activities including military operations are left to its leaders he said others say the insurgency lacks the broader appeal of islamic state in iraq and syria “iswa is the largest is affiliate but it’s very much a nigerian organization it doesn’t have foreign fighters coming it’s hard to get to this place” said the western diplomat what fighters it does have can carry out targeted attacks including the february kidnapping of 100 schoolgirls from the town of dapchi most later released without explanation and a deadly raid on a nigerian military base in march but iswa faces a dilemma while wooing the population it has harshly punished those who resist it for example massacring dozens of fishermen last august and this could hurt its standing with local people “it’s important not to paint too rosy a picture” said foucher the researcher sources voice of america and other sources image islamic state in west africa civilian joint task force

37,the lord’s resistance army is a ugandan rebel group   currently operating in the border region of the democratic republic of   the congo drc the central african republic car and south sudan   joseph kony established the lra in 1988 with the claim of restoring the   honor of his ethnic acholi people and to install a government based on   his personal version of the ten commandments kony claims to channel   various spirits who direct him to oust ugandan president yoweri   museveni however under kony’s leadership lra soldiers   conduct violence for the sake of violence primarily against civilians   rather than fighting to advance a political agenda  the lra has its roots in the conflict between the acholi tribe of   northern uganda and other tribes in southern uganda that began during   idi amin dada’s regime 19711979 power   changed hands between two equally ruthless acholi leaders after idi amin   was overthrown but the acholi were forced to flee back to the north   when museveni seized power in 1986 alienated acholi troops subsequently   formed a less extreme holy spirit movement to counter the ugandan   government however following their defeat in 1988 a more violent movementâthe   lraâ emerged under kony lra soldiers quickly gained a reputation for   murder torture rape and mutilations aimed primarily at acholi   communities as well as abducting tens of thousands of children over the   years to use as sex slaves and child soldiers                    in 2008 following kony’s refusal to sign a negotiated   peace agreement ugandan drc and southern sudanese armies launched a   joint military offensive “operation lightning thunder” against the lra   in northeastern congo as a result the lra broke up into smaller more   mobile groups and spread out in the border region making them even   more difficult to locate in may 2010 the us congress passed the “lord’s resistance   army disarmament and northern uganda recovery act” which follows the us

186,read the diplomat know the asiapacific what looks like an eminently sensible decision given the extremely polluting effects of fireworks has become a politically contentious issue diwali is among the most important hindu festivals in india in the last four years or so however celebrations have become politically contentious the national green tribunal ngt a body empowered to fasttrack cases concerning environmental issues has announced a mix of bans and restrictions on the use of fireworks in cities deemed to have poor air quality fireworks are a staple in diwali celebrations each year burning fireworks contribute a small fraction of air pollution however millions are set off during festivities this can spike pollution levels just a day later in new delhi for instance the air quality index aqi shot up to 454 on november 14 this year – well past the measure for “severe pollution” while the health and environmental effects are fairly evident the politics of fireworks are volatile the annual episode offers a peek into the quagmire of hindu nationalism business interests and regionalism in india “this is nothing but cultural genocide”    the hindu nationalist movement’s central contention is that for far too long the country’s billion or so hindus have been suffering from religious inequality the bharatiya janata party’s bjp’s majoritarian impulses have contributed to formidable backtoback election wins in 2014 and 2019 while hindu nationalism was a growing feature of indian politics for decades it has entrenched itself in the political mainstream over the last six years among the more revolutionary characteristics of the bjp and the broader hindu nationalist movement has been their ability to dominate political discourse online get briefed on the story of the week and developing stories to watch across the asiapacific in the lead up to this year’s diwali popular social media profiles and blogs linked to the hindu rightwing proliferated claims against restrictions placed on the sale and use of fireworks twitter handles such as “true indology” drew on hindu nationalist interpretations of religious texts to argue that hindus have used fireworks for millennia enjoying this article click here to subscribe for full access just 5 a month hindu nationalism is wired toward literalism while gunpowder was invented in the 9th century ce or so the movement believes that fireworks were used to celebrate the victorious return of the godking ram to ayodhya in the ancient hindu epic the ramayana to them it therefore stands to reason that fireworks have always been essential to the cultural practice of diwali adding to their fury is their belief that the ngt has come down hard against hinduism but not islamic or christian practices deemed to be environmentally problematic for this reason they consider the ngt to be run by secular antihindu liberals this is why cyberhindu nationalists have claimed that the doublestandard is a conspiracy against hinduism – quite literally a “cultural genocide” business meets politics roughly 90 percent of india’s fireworks are manufactured in virudhunagar district tamil nadu most manufacturers are based out of sivakasi a town in that district before the restrictions estimates put the industry’s annual value at 50 billion indian rupees roughly 800000 people are either directly or indirectly employed by the industry diwali’s synonymity with fireworks has rendered the festival critical to the industry unsurprisingly lobby groups representing the interests of manufacturers such as the tamil nadu fireworks and amorces manufacturers association tanfama have petitioned courts across the country to overturn the bans these have generally failed however the industry appears to have found a useful ally in hindu nationalists they have been fairly successful at galvanizing hindus to create a groundswell of pressure for instance on november 8 the bjprun karnataka state government backed away from an initial ban to then say that people could use “green” fireworks – a reference to crackers that are 30 percent or so less polluting but still toxic the bjpled haryana state government similarly eased off strict restrictions it had initially announced the bjp madhya pradesh state government distanced itself from restrictions altogether and instead encouraged residents to celebrate with “fervor” relatedly it is also notable that the firebrand bjp chief minister of uttar pradesh up yogi adithyanath ordered the release of a trader who sold fireworks even though he had imposed a ban across much of up a video of the trader’s arrest had gone viral and there was considerable backlash against the up police evidently adityanath found it imperative to play to his base and undermine the legitimacy of his own government’s restrictions to be clear this has hardly been utopian for manufacturers the reality is that sales have come down considerably – generally by 30 to 35 percent yet the episode indicates that hindu nationalist pressure can compel governments to ease off industries considered foundational to hinduism northindiabancrackers   in the last 70 years sivakasi has become a cultural landmark for fireworks its importance to the local economy forced political parties in tamil nadu to the industry’s defense tamil nadu chief minister edappadi k palaniswami member of the all india anna dravida munnetra kazhagam aiadmk sent letters to his counterparts in odisha and rajasthan urging them to reconsider their bans on fireworks the dravida munnetra kazhagam dmk president mk stalin similarly urged rajasthan to ease restrictions on the one hand the statements by the aiadmk and the dmk appear to be little more than a hardnosed response to economic employment and big business considerations yet it is just as important to appreciate how regionalism and tamil nationalism underpinned their actions perhaps the one cleavage with “priceless political value in tamil nadu” is the divide between tamil identity and “northern indian” identity the fact that restrictions on fireworks in many parts of north india had a palpable impact on tamil nadu gave the issue an ideological flavor it was seen as a north indian assault on the economy of tamil nadu even though states such as odisha karnataka and telangana had various permutations of restrictions “the enemy in the north” became the discourse of choice for parties competing to defend the industry indeed all states north of tamil nadu were equated with north india this was perhaps best personified by how jaya tv a popular news network in tamil nadu covered the issue clips of the ban’s impact on sivakasi were frequently accompanied with the hashtag northindiabancrackers enjoying this article click here to

detrimental effect they have on the environment is clear as well however the politics of fireworks in india is a complex web of interests and ideologies all groups opposing the restrictions insist that fireworks have been conveniently scapegoated these have created conditions in which restrictions are routinely ignored coming to a consensus between different interest groups is going to be a herculean task the righttobreathe movement has been extremely partisan while attempts to transition the industry to green crackers looks unlikely to be the panacea but unless regulators can figure a

354,by ini ekott despite recent gains more people in africa live without electricity than anywhere else when it comes to access to energy africas figures are noticeably unimpressive nearly 75 of the worlds 789 million people who lack electricity live in africa according to an october 2020 international energy agency iea report and of the 26 billion people who lack access to clean cooking 900 million are in africa while the rate of rural electrification in other parts of the world is above 70 in subsaharan africa it is just above 20 however there has been progress according to the iea the number of people on the continent without access to electricity which stood at 610 million in 2013 fell to about 580 million in 2019 that gain however has been overshadowed by africas ballooning population and many remain without access to power in the past decades access to electricity in africa failed to level up with its booming population and this negates the drive for development milestones said ubong edet director at open policy a developmentfocused civic group in abuja nigeria attempts by most african nations to significantly increase their citizens access to electricity over the years largely failed hampered by policy missteps poor funding corruption and sometimes instability the result is a dysfunctional power sector that has been unable to support economic activities that can create jobs and education and healthcare services only an estimated 28 of health facilities in subsaharan africa have access to reliable electricity according to powering healthcare a united nations initiative the iea says unless there is considerable improvement in investment and policies africa is certain to default on the global sustainable development goal of 2030 sdg7 which seeks to ensure access to affordable reliable sustainable and modern energy for all the current policy trajectories will see 530 million africans still without electricity in the next decade it says despite progress in several countries current and planned efforts to provide access to modern energy services barely outpace population growth the agency says it is an irony for a continent that is the most endowed with raw energy hydro solar oil gas coal and geothermal resources despite having more solar resources than any other region africa has only five gigawatts of solar photovoltaics  less than 1 of installed global capacity says the iea the bulk of the regions energy deficiency is in subsaharan africa with nigeria ethiopia democratic republic of congo drc uganda and tanzania accounting for the largest number of people without electricity years of efforts by african governments have failed to produce sufficient energy the continent needs for several reasons the first is the funding gap the iea estimates that subsaharan africa needs us 35 billion a year to ensure electricity access for all by 2030 and only a few countries have been able to mobilise enough funds locally for their energy projects ethiopia for example recently raised 8 billion birr out of an expected 12 billion birr about 550 million for its grand renaissance hydroelectric dam through domestic and diaspora bonds corruption is another factor the anticorruption group socioeconomic rights and accountability project said nigeria has spent over 30 billion in the past two decades but has only managed to generate less than 7000 megawatts of electricity far less than required by its over 200 million citizens it said successive administrations squandered the huge amount without commensurate result there is also a policy challenge since joining the electrification trend in the postindependence days poor management and the lack of political will have seen many african countries end up with unrealistic or failed mega energy projects in contrast asia has through the same period accelerated its electrification and achieved the most significant decline in the number of people without electricity worldwide between 2010 and 2018 africas modest improvement has been in east africa here kenya ethiopia and tanzania accounted for more than half of those gaining access to electricity according to the brusselsbased alliance for rural electrification in kenya the electricity access rate rose triple fold within five years to 75 in 2018 as the country complemented grid connections with solar and geothermal systems even with such progress as of july 2020 only one country in africa  gabon  was on track to achieve sdg7 according to an analysis by the sustainable development goals center for africa and the sustainable development solutions network twentytwo countries were moderately increasing 28 were stagnating while three countries were decreasing african countries appear more on track to attain the more drawn out african unions own goal that seeks to harness by 2063 all african energy resources to ensure modern efficient reliable costeffective renewable and environmentally friendly energy to all african households businesses industries and institutions africa will have to raise its funding and actionable plans if it will ever meet up with the rest of the world developmentally in the coming years said edet of open policy access to electricity in africa is also hampered by affordability and reliability the unit cost of electricity to consumers in many african countries is more than double the cost in developed nations such as the united states according to a joint assessment by agence française de développement and the world bank also even in instances where power is available households spend hours without power in 25 of the 29 countries in africa examined by a world bank report fewer than onethird of firms had reliable access to electricity things worked relatively better in liberia namibia and south sudan than in nigeria kenya mali and tanzania the report said solving africas energy problem requires proper funding and policy adjustment experts say offgrid renewable projects like solar should be africas energy future because they are less costly and do not require expensive connections to the national grid especially since the majority of the population reside in rural areas first african countries will have to quadruple their rate of investment in their power sectors for the next two decades to bring reliable electricity to all africans the iea said the agency recommends an annual investment of around 120 billion yearly to bring electricity to all in africa were talking about 25 of gdp that should go into the power sector laura cozzi the ieas chief energy modeller said in november 2019 indias done it over the past 20 years china has done it so its something that is doable given the cost the agency recommends using more minigrids and says attention should be focused more on the huge potential that solar wind hydropower and natural gas offer despite evidence that solar and wind could provide cheaper and more environmentally friendly options to expand electricity in africa a number of african nations are shifting to nuclear energy they cite the threat of drought to hydropower and argue that nuclear power can provide a reliable support for renewables such as solar and wind in addition to south africa which has africas only nuclear power plant ghana morocco egypt kenya nigeria niger tunisia algeria zambia uganda and sudan have considered adopting nuclear energy according to the international atomic energy agency norbert edomah an energy expert and senior lecturer at the panatlantic university lagos says countries should adopt options that work best for them and should consider contextual energy geography close sign up for free allafrica newsletters get the latest in

updated april 21 2019 somerville nj — it was a friday in march at 500 pm on the dot rep tom malinowski and i had just sat down in his largely empty temporary congressional office when special counsel robert mueller informed attorney general william barr that his 22month investigation was complete prompting a dizzying whirlwind of speculation about what comes next malinowski a democrat took his iphone out of his pocket to glance at the update but appeared largely uninterested — and disappointed he put his phone on his desk and changed the subject to something that had happened a mere three hours ago and was at the top of his mind president donald trump had just reversed — via tweet no less — his own treasury department’s decision to impose new sanctions on north korea with the white house press secretary saying trump “likes” kim jong un and therefore believes the harsh financial punishments would have been unnecessary but suddenly the world’s attention shifted to the news that mueller had wrapped up his investigation and the attorney general’s sparse fourpage summary of mueller’s findings trump’s stunning reversal of north korea sanctions would soon be forgotten a fact that irked malinowski who was enraged by the president’s decision “we’re inured to this the president ‘likes’ the leader of an adversary state and therefore will not take action against him” malinowski said in his characteristic deep monotone voice that he almost never raises “you don’t wait for your treasury department to sanction people and then the next day theatrically overturn them you don’t do that” malinowski 53 is just one of nearly 100 members of the freshman class in the house — but he’s quickly becoming one of democrats’ most influential voices on foreign policy educating his fellow members about key issues and aggressively pushing the trump administration to prioritize global human rights issues and reorient its often chaotic foreign policy “hes brought to the committee a wealth of experience and a list of good ideas a mile long” said rep eliot engel dny chairman of the foreign affairs committee on which malinowski sits “hes going to play a big role in our work in the years ahead it’s all the more surprising because malinowski wasn’t supposed to be here born in poland and having immigrated to the us at 6 he spent 12 years as a top official at human rights watch before joining barack obama’s state department as head of the bureau of democracy human rights and labor — hardly the usual launching pads for a congressional career in the 2018 midterms he narrowly defeated a gop incumbent in a republicanleaning centralnorth new jersey district winning in part by flipping longtime republicans in a year that saw a “blue wave” reaction to the president’s first 21 months in office building a public profile around foreignpolicy and national security issues is a daunting task in any era and in a freshman class that includes firebrands like alexandria ocasiocortez and ilhan omar it often seems impossible to jerk the media spotlight over to sobering topics like the famine in yemen yet that’s exactly what malinowski is aiming to do — while assiduously tending to the needs of his constituents officially his top issue is pushing for the construction of the proposed gateway tunnel linking new jersey with manhattan “you know my job in congress dig a tunnel and save the world — in that order” he often says ranking his spot on the transportation committee above membership on the foreign affairs panel but it’s clear that human rights — not bridges and tunnels — remains his true passion calling out and punishing humanrights abusers is one of the few actions that brings republicans and democrats together on capitol hill — and malinowski has a history of finding allies on the other side of the aisle over his years in washington he has cultivated relationships with republicans like the late senator john mccain of arizona with whom he found common ground despite mccain’s stinging criticisms of obama’s policies they worked together during the george w bush administration to oppose the cia’s use of enhanced interrogation techniques and mccain vouched for malinowski at his senate confirmation hearing in september 2013 malinowski highlighted mccain’s praise in a campaign advertisement shortly after the senator’s death the two men often butted heads over obama’s foreign policy even as they often agreed in private malinowski revealed to politico that he worked behind the scenes to fight some of obama’s most criticized foreignpolicy decisions — most notably the initial intervention into yemen’s civil war by providing aid to saudi arabia despite the kingdom’s poor record on human rights and obama’s refusal to set up a nofly zone over syria despite his “red line” on chemicalweapons attacks mccain was for decades the goto authority for congressional republicans on foreign policy and national security matters — and a vocal critic of autocratic regimes democrats had their own hawkish eminence grise until his death in 2008 rep tom lantos of california who like malinowski grew up in the eastern bloc and learned to despise sovietstyle governance but few figures in either party command that kind of authority today — which presents an opportunity for someone with the gravitas and media savvy to step into the vacuum in 2019 republicans maintain a national security edge over democrats though recent polls show that the gap is narrowing many on capitol hill believe the gap can be reversed if democrats can take advantage of trump’s disjointed and often haphazard approach to world affairs it seems unlikely a freshman house member who’s never held elected office before could become a real irritant to the white house on foreign policy — especially in an age when america is turning inward consumed by debates over health care inequality race and immigration and in this “romney republican” congressional district there’s no guarantee that malinowski will be able to stick around longer than just one term in fact he already has a viable republican challenger for 2020 the son of former new jersey governor tom kean but malinowski is betting that americans still deeply care about the world beyond their borders and he projects more worry about the substance of trump’s foreign policy — his praise for dictators like russia’s vladimir putin and north korea’s kim his erratic twitter statements on the use of nuclear weapons his disdain for nato — than politics “i think americans still care i think the state department still cares i think our armed forces still care” he said “every institution cares apart from the white house” malinowski added “and unfortunately the president speaks for the united states so the world gets a warped impression of what the united states is all about right now because of one man and that is consequential but it can be reversed”  for a freshman lawmaker who doesn’t dance on social media or tangle with the president over israel malinowski’s ability to get attention is impressive during a recent house foreign affairs committee hearing he cornered secretary of state mike pompeo on the disconnect between the president calling out venezuela’s socialist government and his praising communist north korea for its economic potential the clip went viral on twitter causing many to ask who’s tom malinowski “if we’re going to be so forceful in denouncing socialism why is the administration so high on communism” malinowski asked “yeah i mean the very statement there is outrageous” pompeo responded going on to defend the trump administrations strict sanctions on pyongyang “why is ‘liking’ kim jong un a sufficient reason to cancel or not to pursue sanctions against companies helping his nuclear program” malinowski retorted referring to trump’s reversal of treasuryapproved sanctions — the same decision that vexed malinowski so much that he shrugged off the completion of the mueller investigation he later brought up trump’s glowing comments about kim and asked pompeo if kim is responsible for the country’s labor camps and the assassinations of his uncle and brother among other human rights abuses “he’s the leader of the country” pompeo said each time “what’s to ‘like’ about kim jong un” malinowski pressed “sir don’t make this a political football it’s inappropriate” pompeo responded it hasn’t always been this easy for malinowski to grab the spotlight though only a few weeks into his tenure he did something almost unheard of on capitol hill in the era of social media virality he walked up to a reporter after a news conference and asked if the confused scribe had any more questions for him “nothing bores me more than people complaining about press coverage and not getting attention” he later said “it’s our job to do things that are worthy of attention and i think we’re doing a pretty good job and i’m satisfied that i’m getting my message out”  before i arrived at his office malinowski was preparing his remarks for a vigil later that night for the victims of the mosque attacks in christchurch new zealand where a white supremacist killed 50 muslim worshippers and wounded dozens more as i walked into his office he asked a staffer to find the names of the victims who were living in new zealand as refugees speaking in a gymnasium at mount olive high school later that night malinowski said those refugees came from syria somalia and afghanistan because they thought they would be safe in new zealand without mentioning trump by name malinowski harangued politicians who employ language about an “invasion” of migrants — as trump had the day after the shootings and during the runup to the 2018 midterm elections at the vigil he implored attendees to “call out anyone in this country who uses language that is in any way similar to the language that those terrorists use” the crowd did something that rarely happens at vigils it stood up and applauded for nearly a minute before malinowski could continue speaking “the shooter in new zealand said exactly the same thing immigrants are invading western countries” malinowski told me in his office “and when the president responds the next day after the massacre in new zealand by repeating that immigrants are invading america that does not make people in my district feel more safe any more than they would have felt safe if barack obama had echoed the propaganda of isis after an isis attack so this isn’t politics this is serious business this is about protecting our country and protecting our people it’s about defending our law enforcement institutions defending our intelligence community” he recently introduced a resolution condemning white supremacist rhetoric and those who amplify or repeat it the legislation doesn’t mention trump specifically but it’s an implicit dig at the president with a twist the resolution almost entirely consists of quotes from conservative darling ronald reagans final speech as president it was an address malinowski described as a “love letter” to immigration it’s something close to his heart as an immigrant himself “the idea would be to ask republicans to choose between reagan and trump” malinowski said “this is becoming a national security issue and i want us to stop playing defense on immigration and start playing offense and point out that this demonization of immigrants and this spreading of outright paranoid lies about invasions of rapists and killers is radicalizing a portion of the american population in ways that are dangerous to all of us” “it’s scary” he said at another point in our interview “it’s like nothing i’ve ever seen before in our country and it’s a problem we’re going to be dealing with i fear after trump is gone”  as alarmed as malinowski can sound about trump he finds himself in a curious political position in his historically republican district he could not have won by bashing the president all the time on domestic issues he positions himself as a moderate democrat rejecting progressive goals like medicare for all and the green new deal as irresponsible and unrealistic at the same time he viewed 2018 as a turning point for the two political parties in malinowski’s view republicans had all but abandoned the core principles that americans had associated with the party of lincoln “i felt like i was running as the candidate of the party of patriotism in america the party of law enforcement in america the party that wants to defend our country against foreign adversaries the party of family values — since our presidents don’t pay off porn stars while they’re in the white house” he said “these are all principles that used to be associated with the republican party and i proudly embrace them and believe that my party stands for them today” the democratic congressional campaign committee advised malinowski that to win his race against republican incumbent leonard lance the safest thing to do was to run on the party’s health care message don’t take the bait the democratic strategists in washington warned on trump’s latestage rhetoric about a migrant caravan coming to “invade” the country the new jersey democrat ignored that counsel one of his final ads of the campaign cycle titled “rejecting fear” featured malinowski explicitly pushing back on trump’s closing message “they want you scared — scared of your neighbors scared of me” malinowski thinks the message resonated in part because of the ethnic diversity in new jersey’s 7th congressional district and the fact that 20 percent of its residents were born outside the us “democrats can talk about these issues so long as we frame them in the right way” malinowski insisted to me “i’m not an alarmist i speak calmly and precisely about what’s happening in our country and to our community”  malinowski’s presence on capitol hill — particularly his perch on the foreign affairs committee — irks some of his republican colleagues “anything to do with the horrid foreign policy of president obama it’s not healthy for our country so we can’t support that” said rep ted yoho rfla a longtime member of the foreign affairs committee naming the iran nuclear deal and other cornerstones of obama’s foreign policy “the bad policies that obama did have really damaged this country” but malinowski has also used his state department experience to his advantage on the panel during a committee debate about a war powers resolution to withdraw us support for the saudiled coalition in yemen republicans were arguing that the effort was illconceived because the us is not engaged in “hostilities” in yemen malinowski fired back explaining that he was involved in the discussions when the obama administration decided to get involved in yemen in the first place the obama administration considered the us to be formally engaged in hostilities in yemen malinowski countered  rep tom malinowski listens to california rep jimmy panetta discuss legislation supporting nato on jan 22 2019  andrew harnikap photo “if a foreign power was bombing washington dc and a second foreign power was refueling the first power’s aircraft over chesapeake bay on their way to drop ordnance on the capitol building we’d consider both countries to be at war with us obviously” malinowski told me “and if we’re refueling saudi aircraft if we’re servicing them on the tarmac helping them get back into the air we’re part of this conflict and therefore need to make responsible decisions” most — if not all — firsttime members of congress have never been in a classified briefing malinowski’s fellow freshman lawmakers often lean on his executive branch experience when drawing their own conclusions every democrat ended up voting in favor of the yemen war powers resolution a remarkable and rare show of democratic unity on a fraught foreignpolicy issue “witnesses can’t get things by him” said rep ted lieu dcalif a fellow foreign affairs committee member “he’s able to provide a lot of knowledge for the members of the committee but he also uses it on the floor”  despite the gop criticisms malinowski is far from an obama sycophant during his tenure as assistant secretary of state for democracy human rights and labor he was often a dissenting voice among the obama foreignpolicy brass republicans like mccain took notice “we fought together in the trenches to do something that we both passionately believed in” malinowski said of his work with mccain on banning the use of torture “he won my lifelong loyalty and admiration in that fight” but mccain an ardent critic of obama’s foreign policy often used malinowski as a punching bag to vent about what he viewed as a disjointed and dangerous series of foreignpolicy decisions — including the last time they saw each other in mccain’s senate office in 2017 “he reamed me out about my support for banning arms sales to saudi arabia he said ‘are you one of those people who think we should stop selling precisionguided munitions to saudi arabia’ and he gave me a look that could kill” malinowski said with a laugh “i tried to shift the subject as quickly as i could” “i loved him and he liked a good fight and always — he jumped into the toughest fights and was never afraid of taking a strong position on a difficult issue and i try to be the same way and sometimes that meant we were on opposing sides and it did not and could not have affected our friendship” malinowski agreed with one of mccain’s central critiques of obama’s foreign policy that the us should have done more to stanch the bloodshed in syria after obama’s “red line” but malinowski who at the time was a senior official on the president’s national security team couldn’t project his views publicly instead he tried to change obama’s course from the inside “when i was working with the president for the president i made my opinions known in a way that one responsibly does as a member of the administration” he said on syria though malinowski struck out obama was reluctant to do anything that would drag the us into a prolonged conflict in the region even as syrian president bashar assad was deploying chemical weapons on his own people malinowski wanted to set up a nofly zone well before russia staged a military intervention in 2015 the idea would have been to prevent syrian fighter jets from flying over cities like aleppo and threaten to shoot down aircraft that crossed into oppositionheld areas but once the russians got involved all bets were off malinowski argues that had his view prevailed the cascading and disastrous global effects of the syrian civil war would have been mitigated — even prevented “the 5 million refugees the rise of isis chemical weapons attacks the russian intervention — i think we had a chance to prevent those things and they had an impact well beyond syria” malinowski said “i don’t think brexit would have happened if not for syrian refugees flooding europe and creating this fear of an immigrant invasion it affected our politics in ways that can’t be quantified but it certainly affected our politics the fear of isis and the fear of refugees have been a powerful driver in western politics for the last few years and both of those problems came to us courtesy of syria”  searing foreignpolicy dilemmas like syria — when and how america should intervene abroad — have been dividing the democratic party for generations during the cold war the left clashed with hawks like washington senator henry “scoop” jackson over how seriously to take the soviet threat after the cold war ended it was conflicts like bosnia and iraq that fueled heated intraparty debates but even though trump has scrambled the usual trench lines on national security through his mix of isolationism and pugnacious nationalism the democratic party is surprisingly unified on these issues — for nowhouse democrats would be wise to take advantage of that unity malinowski argues especially as liberal firebrands fuel intraparty divisions that often grab headlines and drive unfavorable media coverage of the house democratic majority his advice eyes on the prize “we have the same basic vision for the general direction the country should go in” malinowski told me in closing “we have interesting differences about how to do it but those differences are not going to play out in a meaningful way in the house in the next two years because donald trump is the glue that holds us all together we know the country’s in crisis we know that this is not a time for transforming america this is a time for saving america preserving america and there will be plenty of time if we succeed in preserving our institutions preserving our democracy there will be plenty of time in the coming years to argue about differences in policy”  © 2020 politico llc,2
196,the bellingcat investigation team is an award winning group of volunteers and full time investigators who make up the core of the bellingcats investigative efforts on october 15 2020 the european union imposed sanctions on six senior russian officials and a leading russian research institute over the alleged use of a nerve agent from the novichok family in the poisoning of opposition leader alexey navalny russia dismissed as baseless the eu’s allegations that it had not complied with its obligations under the convention it ratified in 1997 to discontinue its chemical weapons program russian officials said the country had nothing to do with navalny’s poisoning and implied that if any party had used nerve agents on him it would have been western secret services vladimir putin who in 2017 had personally watched over the destruction of the last remaining russian chemical weapons stash ridiculed the findings of four separate laboratories confirmed by the opcw that a novichoktype organophosphate poison was identified in alexey navalny’s blood two years earlier in 2018 russia had dismissed as unfounded allegations that its military intelligence had used novichok to poison former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter similarly russia had then stated that it had no ongoing chemical weapons program and had destroyed all of its prior arsenals while alluding that uk agencies may have used their own stash of novichok to poison the skripals in a falseflag operation a yearlong investigation by bellingcat and its investigative partners the insider and der spiegel with contributing investigations from rferl has discovered evidence that russia continued its novichok development program long beyond the officially announced closure date data shows that military scientists who were involved with the original chemical weapons program while it was still run by the ministry of defense were dispersed into several research entities which continued collaborating among one another in a clandestine distributed rd program while some of these institutes were integrated with the ministry of defense – but camouflaged their work as research into antidotes to organophosphate poisoning – other researchers moved to civilian research institutes but may have continued working under cover of civilian research on the continued program our investigative team believes the st petersburg state institute for experimental military medicine of the ministry of defense “gnii vm” likely with the assistance of researchers from the scientific center signal “sc signal” has since 2010 taken the lead role in the continued rd and weaponization of the sovietera novichok program crucially for our conclusions we have identified evidence showing close coordination between these two institutes and a secretive subunit of military unit 29155 of russia’s military intelligence the gru this unit has previously been linked to the poisoning attempts on emilian gebrev in bulgaria in 2015 as well as sergey and yula skripal in the united kingdom in 2018 telecoms data we obtained shows that the st petersurgbased institute communicated intensively with members of the assassination team during the planning stage of the skripal mission while also communicating – at highly correlated moments – with scientists from sc signal the two research institutes also appear to collaborate with the 33rd central experimental institute for scientific research of the ministry of defense located in the town of shikhany this agency was originally involved in researching and testing the russian chemical weapons program furthermore our research has established that these two institutes were in frequent communication – including during the planning state of the skripal operation – with russia’s scientific institute for organic chemistry and technology “gosniioht” the agency that was tasked with supervising the destruction of russia’s arsenal of nerve agents and ensuring the termination of the country’s cw program the role of the 33rd central institute and the gosniioht in the development of russia’s nerve agent program was previously known and the these two institutes were sanctioned by the european union however neither gnii vm nor sc signal have been sanctioned by european or us governments and it appears that their work has stayed outside of the focus of western intelligence services extreme toxicology at gnii vm the sprawling complex of the institute for experimental military medicine outside st petersburg photo the insider gnii vm the ministry of defense’s institute for experimental medicine is a secretive military research unit located just outside st petersburg there is scant public information about this establishment’s structure personnel and projects a succinct listing of the institute’s history and functions on the defense ministry’s website suggests that prior to 2015 it had existed as an adjunct research center within russia’s kirov military medical academy and had been focused on researching “the ergonomic properties of russian armaments” as of may 2015 however the institute was given autonomy and a new focus including “organization of scientific research in the interest of russia’s defense and national security” and “conducting tests of the developed products” an internal 2017 presentation of the institute obtained by our team shows that – at least officially – its main functions were developing and testing emergency medical equipment medication and treatment techniques for wartime use in particular the institute reported it was developing an antidote to organophosphate poisoning with its development being – in 2017 – in a “preclinical trial stage” a rare public lecture announcement from 2018 shows that leading researchers from the institute were specializing on the effects of organophosphate poisons on the human body – and were tracking the international development of antidotes to those poisons from the novichok group fall into the larger group of organophosphates – which includes also certain pesticides  the st petersburg institute is headed by sergey chepur a 50year old military doctor and expert in extreme toxicology with a special interest in the effects of organophosphate poisons on the human body there are no opensource photographs of its director sergey chepur and a rare public mention of his name is contained in a september 2020 announcement of an achievement award for his contribution to military medicine as a research entity serving the ministry of defense the st petersburg’s institute has a legitimate and plausible interest in developing antidotes for nerve agents including organophosphates however telecoms data we obtained shows that key researchers from the institute are integrated with russia’s military intelligence including its blackoperations unit a clandestine subunit of gru’s unit 29155 to a degree that cannot be explained away by purely defensive considerations after initially stumbling upon the phone number of the institute’s chairman sergey chepur in phone call records of unit 29155’s commander maj general andrey averyanov the same number kept popping up in phone records of other members of the blackops team including the main suspects in the poisonings in bulgaria and the uk this prompted us to obtain chepur’s own phone records they showed that he had repeated communication with at least four members of the clandestine team and that the communications peaked just before undercover international operations undertaken by the gru officers furthemore the phone records contained metadata showing that sergey chepur visited the headquarters of the gru during what appeared to be preparation meetings on the eve of the 2018 salisbury operation in the period from november 2017 until early march 2018 – when the skripal poisoning operation would have been planned by the gru – chepur spoke repeatedly with members of unit 29155 he spoke or texted with the unit’s commander andrey averyanov at least 65 times the data about these interactions were purged from averyanov’s phone records but remained visible in chepur’s phone metadata in this period he also communicated repeatedly with maj gen denis sergeev also known under his cover identity of “sergey fedotov” who supervised both the gebrev poisoning operation in 2015 and the 2018 skripal poisoning chepur also spoke and texted many times with alexander mishkin aka “alexander petrov” one of the two suspects wanted by uk law enforcement over the skripal poisonings as well as with col alexander kovalchuk both kovalchuk and mishkin are part of the clandestineoperations gru team and are medical doctors who graduated from the kirov medical military academy in st petersburg alexander kovalchuk did not travel to the united kingdom during the salisbury mission but remained at the gru headquarters during the three days of the operation which extended into the weekend phone records for 2017 and 2018 show that sergey chepur contacted alexander mishkin for the first time three months before the skripal poisoning on the december 30 2017 the very next day mishkin traveling under the false identity of “alexander petrov” took a flight from russia to switzerland his travel data shows on the day mishkin left for geneva col anatoly chepiga – aka “ruslan boshirov” the second suspect in the skripal poisonings – arrived back from geneva to moscow during the period from christmas 2017 until the end of february 2018 at least five members of unit 29155 traveled to switzerland on a staggered schedule usually with at least two undercover officers being in the country at any given time the last member of the team departed from geneva to moscow on march 1 2018 the same day on which sergeeev mishkin and chepiga bought tickets for their flight to london the next day bellingcat has previously reported on the relevance of switzerland as a frequently visited location by unit 29155 and has hypothesized that the skripal attack may have been prepared there or that alternatively the gru may have expected sergei skripal to travel to switzerland during the holiday period the calls between chepur and mishkin in the immediate runup to the “new year trips” corroborate our earlier hypothesis it is unlikely that the relatively small gru elite team would have had the capacity to work on two separate operations in such a small stretch of time  immediately following mishkin’s return from switzerland on january 12 2018 sergey chepur had several calls with mishkin and his boss andrey averyanov on january 13 14 17 and 18 a month before the salisbury operation on february 2 and 3 2018 chepur was contacted for the first time by denis sergeev serveev as we previously reported oversaw the poisoning mission from a london hotel room where he kept continuous communication with a burner phone number in russia on the evening of february 12 2018 in the course of 17 minutes from 2059 to 2116 chepur contacted three gru officers from the clandestine unit – mishkin sergeev and kovalchuk on 18 january chepur took a oneday trip to moscow and spent the day at the gru headquarters metadata from mishkin sergeev and kovalchuk’s phone show they were at the same location at the same time the previous day denis sergeev had returned from geneva where he had spent a week chepur also had a vast number of interactions with the gru team on the february 23 2018 in russia this date is celebrated as defender of the fatherland day and it is customary for the military to send celebratory messages to each other however chepur’s communication with the gru team members stand out from the rest as they extend late into the evening ending with a midnight 2359 conversation with alexander kovalchuk the number of interactions and the latenight exchanges suggest they were likely linked to the planning of the skripal operation which was to take place just a week later crucially on february 27 2018 just three days before the gru trio departed for london chepur flew to moscow on a oneday trip upon arrival in moscow he communicated with several gru officers as well as with members of another research institute sc signal afterwards he headed for the headquarters of the gru where he spent several hours sergeev mishkin and kovalchuk were also present at the gru headquarters at the same time following his three hour stay there chepur made two further phone calls to a key researcher from sc signal chepur then moved to the territory of 27th military scientific center at baumanskaya st during this visit which lasted just over an hour he had several further calls with one of sc signal’s lead scientists and organophosphates specialists victor taranchenko our hypothesis is that during this day – february 27 2018 – final preparations for the upcoming assassination mission in salisbury were made in moscow including for the delivery of the poison and the tools for its applicators to the gru blackops unit a key part of russia’s official chemical weapons program prior to its termination was conducted by the 33rd central scientificresearch institute of the ministry of defense this institute based in the formerly closed military town shikhany2 near saratov was the rd base for development of a particularly powerful strand of organophosphate nerve agents commonly referred to as “novichoks” another military institute that had an ancillary role in the development and testing of nerve agents was the 27th scientific center which was briefly incorporated into the 33rd center this institute oversees one of the two russian chemicalanalytical labs accredited by the opcw in analyzing sergey chepur’s call metadata we identified a correlation between his calls and visits with gru’s unit 29155 and calls with several researchers who had formerly worked for the 27th scientific center these included the former chairman of the center – artur zhirov as well as his former colleagues andrey antokhin and victor taranchenko chepur spoke with artur jirov on 11 18 and 30 january 2018 on one of the days – the 18 – not long after a phone call to alexander mishkin however the most notable correlation is with chepur’s communication with viktor taranchenko taranchenko was the first person chepur called once he landed in moscow on february 27 and just before he headed to the gru headquarters once he was at the gru and presumably during the planning meeting for the upcoming salisbury operation the two exchanged several text messages while still working at the 27th scientific center taranchenko and his colleague antokhin had specialized in research of cholinesterase inhibitors a broad class to which the novichok and other powerful nerve agents belong artur zhirov on the other hand had specialized in research of nanoencapsulation an innovative technique permitting the embedding of chemical compounds into a celllike membranecovered structure made of other compounds this technique appeared to be a promising solution to the necessity to delay the onset of the effects of certain pharmaceuticals taranchenko like antokhin and several other key researchers from the 27th scientific center had followed their former boss in 2010 when he left the center to become the founding ceo of a new scientific research center created through a presidential decree the generically named scientific center “signal” sc signal is incorporated into the structure of russia’s export control agency and its official function is to ensure technical and scientific control over the exports of russian materials including “chemicals and technologies that can be used in the manufacturing of chemical weapons” sc signal and the st petersburg experimentalmedicine institute work on two publicly known projects which in theory could explain the interaction between sergey chepur and the signal researchers however the correlation between the calls with sc signal and members of unit 29155 as well as a visit by chepur to one of the addresses of sc signal on january 31 2018 following which he continued to the gru headquarters suggest that the contacts between chepur and the sc signal are likely linked to the planning of the salisbury operation one of the labs of sc signal is located at natatinskaya 16 in moscow the same address houses one of russia’s military institutes tasked with the destruction of russia”s chemical weapons arsenal according to several experts contacted by our team the technique of nanoencapsulation – which appears to be the area of specialization of many of the researchers working at sc signal – may be successfully applied in the application of organophosphate nerve agents such as the novichoks through this method experts say three effects might be achieved that would improve the efficiency and ease of application of the poison first nanoencapsulation could delay the onset of the poison by several hours which may be desirable in clandestine operations second it can improve the rate and speed of absorption through the target’s skin third it can provide an opportunity for masking the presence of the active ingredients of novichok through the overwhelming presence in the victim’s body of chemical compounds from the cell’s “membrane” – which can be a different decoy poisonous substance notably both in the cases of the poisoning of emilian gebrev in 2015 and in the case of navalny presence of other nonnovichok – and much less dangerous poisons – in the targets’ blood were reported when approached by our team to comment on the possible link between the sc signal and the ministry of defense’s continued program for development of novichok the institute’s chairman artur zhirov hung up the telephone after hearing the question and without uttering a word reached by telephone and asked about his possible involvement in the development of organophosphate poisons mr taranchenko denied and said he was not even an expert in organophosphates – which appears to be contradicted by his body of published research confronted by phone about his frequent interactions with members of gru’s unit 29155 mr sergey chepur said he had never spoken to any of alexander mishkin denis sergeev or andrey averyanov he also appeared to clearly remember that he did not visit the gru headquarters on february 27 2018 before hanging up he advised us to “stop lying to everyone including to yourselves”         your donation to bellingcat is a direct contribution to

182,read the diplomat know the asiapacific if the foip strategy is to succeed the two countries have some work to do with the inauguration of the new biden administration approaching america’s east asian allies are beginning to turn their attention to japan–south korea relations the new administration has announced its intention to bolster relations with allies and although we don’t yet know if it will be using the term free and open indopacific foip we can expect it to emphasize security in the indopacific with china in mind given that south korea’s attitude is a matter of concern south korea is not only distancing itself from foip but is also displaying relative indifference to any vision of regional security outside the korean peninsula the basis of south korean foreign policy and especially that of the moon jaein administration can be said to be its north korea policy the principal issues appear to be unification and dialogue with north korea this is why seoul has been passive on foip and other regional visions even when visiting southeast asia president moon jaein did not mention foip this contrasts significantly with former prime minister abe shinzo and his successor suga yoshihide one reason why south korea may be cool on foip is that it is perceived to have emanated from a proposal by abe these issues in japan–south korea relations may also color seoul’s thinking on other regional visions with abe having stepped down it is not surprising then that many people see an opportunity to improve japan–south korea relations apparently this thinking is present in washington as well the us state department was actually making plans to draw the south korean government and south korea towards the foip toward the end of the trump administration and with the uk likewise starting to develop a new indopacific policy it too could serve as a mediator for better japan–south korea relations a japan–south korea telephone summit was held in september during the call suga noted the importance of the bilateral relationship perhaps suggesting a policy of giving south korea more emphasis than the abe administration did yet since then suga has only referred to japan–us–south korea collaboration on the north korea issues while maintaining abe’s policy on matters such as the wartime korean labor suga spoke about the wartime labor issue and other sensitive aspects of japan–south korea relations to a delegation of south korean lawmakers visiting japan in connection with the korea–japan forum held in november saying that he “would like to see action on the south korean side to improve bilateral relations” this appears to suggest a proactive approach to better ties but it can also be taken to indicate that he sees the cause of worsening relations as lying with south korea get briefed on the story of the week and developing stories to watch across the asiapacific that attitude is unlikely to go down well in south korea yet the september call was initiated by seoul so perhaps south korean is also looking for ways to improve relations it remains difficult however to know just how motivated it is either when it comes to japan or the trilateral relationship with the us and south korea enjoying this article click here to subscribe for full access just 5 a month as things stand china and north korea seem to be getting on well china continues to prop up the north korean economy and likewise extended a helping hand following the natural disasters and food shortages that occurred in the wake of the multiple typhoons that hit the country in 2020 the 70th anniversary of the korean war may well be used to showcase robust relations between the two countries in any case china has a stronger pipeline to north korea than the us does for the moon jaein administration this means that china is more “dependable” than the us is since moon considers korean unification and dialogue with north korea his foremost tasks of course china won’t necessarily to dance to south korea’s tune but since beijing wants to distance the us from its allies within the region while encouraging schisms among the regional allies themselves it would very likely welcome rapprochement with south korea what should be remembered though is that beijing will only act in its own interests moon should recall the experience of the park geunhye administration which had its own plans for china but got nowhere with them as the covid19 pandemic continues to rage in many parts of the region china is stepping up its activities in nearby waters and border areas while deploying more vigorous policy measures toward its neighbors those neighbors are now confronted with heavy pressure from beijing and may be feeling the pressure to rethink their regional relations and the regional order northeast asia is a key part of the foip strategy for the strategy to produce results japan and south korea face major tasks rebuilding trust achieving consensus on the world situation and resetting common goals amid the perception gaps and misunderstandings that currently prevail shin kawashima is a professor at the university of tokyo,3
115,regiondetailtext persondetailtext organizationdetailtext seriesdescription  limitto140 this piece is part of a series of al shabaab leadership profiles sheikh mukhtar robow also known as abu mansur was the deputy leader of al shabaab and a former spokesman for the group1 robow was one of the original founders of al shabaab2 he reportedly turned himself in to the somali government in july 2013 but his defection is unconfirmed3 he was added to the united states treasury department’s office of foreign assets control ofac specially designated global terrorist sdgt list under executive order 13224 on november 20 20084 the state department authorized a reward of up to 5 million for information leading to his location on june 7 20125 the united nations has not designated him as a terrorist he is from baidoa in the bay region of somalia where his rahanweyn clan holds overwhelming influence6 contrary to most reports ofac lists robow as a native of huddur xudur in bakool region it also notes that he has used the alias mukhtar abdullahi ali on an eritrean passport with a birthplace of keren eritrea7 he established the first militant islamist training camp in somalia al hudda in huddur in 19968 robow reportedly left somalia in 2000 to train with the taliban in afghanistan returning to somalia after the taliban fell from power9 in 2003 he helped create al shabaab from the remnants of al ittihad al islamiya although the group remained effectively dormant until ethiopia occupied somalia at the end of 200610 he served as a prominent military commander for the islamic courts union in its fight against the ruling coalition of warlords11  robow also promotes a degree of transnational jihadist activity despite accusations from al shabaab leader mukhtar abu zubair also known as godane and his allies that robow is excessively “clannist”12 likewise robow has publicly endorsed the role of foreign fighters in al shabaab’s insurgent campaign “fellow muslims have the right to come to somalia to support our cause to establish an islamic state and defeat the prowestern politicians” he said in september 200913 though his vision has been reported as being focused on greater somalia including ethnically somali regions of kenya and ethiopia robow has supported fighting internationally on january 1 2010 he told hundreds of newly trained al shabaab militants in mogadishu that he would send them to yemen to fight with al qaeda “these young fighters successfully completed several months of tough training and they are now ready to join their brothers in the holy war against the enemy of allah worldwide he said14 additionally he supports attacks against states that meddle in somali affairs including uganda and kenya on march 7 2011 robow threatened kenya with a repeat of the devastating bombings that rocked uganda on july 11 2010 “if the so called kenyan government thinks that we are easy we are telling them that we are not the world is witness that we were behind the deadly explosions which have taken place in the ugandan capital kampala during the final match of the of the so called world cup” he said15 robow is committed to a state governed by shari’a law having personally instituted it in baidoa following ethiopia’s withdrawal in january 2009 we are informing all somalis we want to rule with justice and the almighty allahs sharia law we are informing somalis we will not accept any manmade constitution we will not accept it we shall fight with anyone who opposes it he said16 unlike other elements in al shabaab’s leadership robow respects the clan system and has at times protected somali government members from his clan17 these dispositions have created a rift between him and godane who disapproves of the clan system and espouses a global jihadist view18 al shabaab leaders removed robow from his spokesman position in february 2009 after a media outlet published allegations that robow was negotiating with transitional federal government tfg president sheikh sharif sheikh ahmed19 garowe online reported in december 2009 that robow was seeking to change al shabaab’s doctrine to allow for negotiation with the somali government in an attempt to end the conflict20 another rupture between robow and godane erupted in october 2010 following al shabaab’s ramadan offensive in mogadishu robow reportedly withdrew his

new                          the biden transition this article is part of the biden transition foreign policy’s ongoing coverage of how us presidentelect joe biden builds a new white house administration—and what the new team’s policies might be although presidentelect joe biden had promised before this year’s us election that he would return to the nuclear deal with iran doing so will be very difficult for him and for all those who hope that the 2015 agreement will be revived with us support biden will take office on jan 20 and will not have much time to revive the deal if that is his plan there will be about five months while moderate president hassan rouhani whose administration signed the deal is still in power in tehran that’s because the next iranian president to be elected in june 2021 will likely be one of iran’s hardliners they opposed signing the deal long before outgoing president donald trump withdrew from it in may 2018—and they would harshly criticize rouhani and his foreign minister mohammad javad zarif for signing what they perceive as a weak agreement with the united states although rouhani himself will not be able to run again due to term limits members of his cabinet or politicians close to the reformists and moderates will certainly compete under the current circumstances reformists and moderates have no chance of winning the election unless the deal returns to the center of iranian politics a revival of the deal by biden would boost the iranian economy and more importantly lead to the appreciation of the iranian rial ahead of the presidential election—a significant issue for ordinary iranians suffering from inflation and one that could convince them to vote for prodiplomacy reformists even so the moderates will have a difficult job persuading voters in the upcoming elections to come to the polls and without the deal’s revival they will definitely lose politicians from various factions believe that low turnout will help the hardliners win the election as this year’s parliamentary elections proved in the february 2020 parliamentary elections the lowest turnout since the 1979 revolution gave an absolute majority to the hardliners according to the official figures the turnout stood at only 42 percent overall in the whole country with only 26 percent of the people in tehran province coming to the ballot box although there is no official polling in iran reformist and moderate politicians are not optimistic about their base in the next year’s presidential election mahmoud sadeghi a former lawmaker from tehran in the previous parliament predicted in an interview on june 20 2020 that no more than 30 percent of the population would turn out in next year’s presidential race since low turnout in the islamic republic elections has historically meant hardliner victories this decline in turnout rate would be good news for conservatives they could return to power and the world will face a similar experience to what it went through during the administration of president mahmoud ahmadinejad from 2005 to 2013 iran’s hardliners are already angry about biden’s victory in the us election because they believe that if trump had been reelected they would have been able bring down the reformists and moderates but they are now worried that the opposite camp could stay in power with biden at the white house “a government that has for many times sought to negotiate with trump over the past four years lacks the ability to distinguish opportunity from threat” mehdi mohammadi an adviser to hardliner parliament speaker mohammad baqer qalibaf tweeted on nov 13 the hardliner politician and columnist with the vataneemrooz newspaper one of the main conservative media outlets in iran added “if only one thing is certain it is that jcpoa joint comprehensive plan of action cannot lift the sanctions” antinegotiation arguments like these are common in the iranian media these days on nov 10 ahmad naderi a lawmaker in the iranian parliament representing tehran described the nuclear deal as dead “there is nothing left of the jcpoa and if wisdom prevails in our foreign policy we should never return to this agreement to which no one is committed anymore” naderi added “democrats have always imposed the most sanctions on iran but the prowestern current in iran still thinks that biden’s presidency will solve the country’s problems which is very unrealistic” such statements and warnings followed the biden team’s statement promising that “if tehran returns to compliance with the deal president biden would reenter the agreement using hardnosed diplomacy and support from our allies to strengthen and extend it while more effectively pushing back against iran’s other destabilizing activities” meanwhile in a speech on nov15 qalibaf criticized the rouhani government’s poor economic record and advised the president to focus on the country’s internal capabilities he urged rouhani to look for solutions to the problems at home not from washington on the same day a column in the weekly sobhe sadegh belonging to the political bureau of the islamic revolutionary guard corps irgc called for returning responsibility for leading the nuclear talks from the ministry of foreign affairs—headed by zarif a moderate—to the country’s supreme national security council snsc when biden takes office the snsc is run by admiral ali shamkhani and saeed jalili—the former nuclear negotiator during ahmadinejad’s era—is a senior member if biden sets any nonnuclear preconditions as prerequisites for returning to the deal he would simply be letting down all those who are hoping to revive the accord if biden sets any nonnuclear preconditions—issues such as addressing iran’s missile program or the human rights situation in the country—as prerequisites for returning to the deal he would simply be letting down all those who are hoping to revive the accord and play into the conservatives’ attempt to sabotage a deal hardliners after all have been arguing for decades that the united states will not ease its pressure unless the islamic republic fundamentally changes or disappears with such limited time to reach a deal adding any other issues to the negotiations will make it impossible for the two sides to reach a deal in the next few months biden will simply not have time to lay the groundwork for a process similar to the one that led to the signing of the landmark 2015 agreement meanwhile the wideranging sanctions that the trump administration has imposed on tehran has left almost no room for the rouhani administration to maneuver in the domestic political arena and he appears emptyhanded when he comes under attack from his hardliner opponents as a result it will not be surprising if hardliners in iran and the groups they control resort to acts of sabotage in the region in the coming months in order to disrupt any possible agreement between iran and the united states that’s because hardliners are trying their best to undermine an atmosphere conducive to negotiations between the rouhani government and the biden white house the incoming administration needs to be even more prepared for further destructive action by the iranian hardliners—both inside and outside the region—with the aim of hindering a new deal read more the killing of

in the next presidential election some political activists and media outlets close to the reformists have been pushing for his candidacy on the opposite side the hardliners have recently intensified their campaign to defame the foreign minister for fear that if he enters the race it will be harder for them to win despite increasing attacks on zarif from the right he has remained popular and is capable of garnering the support of iranians in various published polls zarif is among the most popular figures in the country and his extraordinary rhetorical skills would cause problems for his rivals in an election campaign even if the deal is revived and zarif enters the race for president there would no guarantee that the dissatisfied tired and angry people of iran would be willing to turn out at the polls but there is one definite possibility if biden fails to revive the jcpoa in the coming months and the pronegotiation camp fails to win the june 2021 election his foreignpolicy team will have to prepare themselves to negotiate and deal with a conservative president similar to ahmadinejad and a hardliner diplomat like jalili for the next four years they would be far less

masters  by andrew nagorski august 30 2019 andrew nagorski is a former newsweek foreign correspondent and editor whose postings included hong kong warsaw and moscow he is the author of 1941 the year germany lost the war as tensions continue to escalate in hong kong especially after the police arrested two protest leaders on friday in an attempt to discourage new mass rallies planned for this weekend the greatest fear is that mainland china will intervene directly with overwhelming force in that case hong kong could become the scene of another crackdown on the scale of beijing’s tiananmen square massacre in 1989—or possibly even worse given the widespread expectation that the hong kong protesters would fight back but this worstcase scenario may be less likely than another outcome based on a completely different analogy poland in 1981 in that fateful year poland’s solidarity labor movement challenged the country’s—and the kremlin’s—communist rulers as never before what played out in the gdansk shipyard and in factories and streets all across the country ended in a show of force by the polish government to moscow’s relief the power play temporarily protected communist party rule thwarting the workers challenging the putative workers’ state ultimately however it only postponed the demise of a government that lost any remaining shred of legitimacy after the widely decried clampdown as in hong kong democratic aspirations underpinned the poles’ demands for an end to food shortages and the other egregious economic failings of the sovietimposed system and just like in hong kong and beijing the communist authorities were increasingly at a loss about how to handle the escalating demands of the protesters while maintaining their control of the levers of power china’s late leader deng xiaoping famously enunciated the concept of “one country two systems” that was supposed to guarantee hong kong’s autonomy after british rule ended in 1997 this was meant to reassure hong kong’s inhabitants that they would enjoy a privileged position as compared with their compatriots on the mainland—although beijing was now the ultimate authority while soviet rulers preserved the fiction of poland’s complete independence once they installed a communist government in warsaw at the end of world war ii they operated on a similar principle call it “one empire two systems” within the soviet bloc poles carved out a special place for themselves although communist apparatchiks called the political shots they recognized quickly that they could not follow their usual pattern of collectivizing agriculture and cracking down on religion poland’s fiercely independent small farmers would not tolerate the former and the catholic church commanded the allegiance of the overwhelming majority of the population who would have revolted before tolerating the latter nonetheless poles increasingly wanted much more than that when the communist party chief edward gierek sharply raised meat prices in the summer of 1980 a wave of strikes culminated in the creation of solidarity gierek gave in to pressure to legalize the new movement but he was promptly replaced by stanislaw kania the new leader was faced with the impossible challenge of both satisfying solidarity and the kremlin like carrie lam the beijingapproved leader of hong kong kania claimed to support dialogue but warned protesters that their increasing militancy could end badly for everyone soviet forces were sent on maneuvers near poland and the kremlin intoned that solidarity was jeopardizing the “independent existence” of poland which could lead to “a confrontation threatening bloodshed” similarly chinese troops and police have put on shows of force near hong kong in case anyone missed the point china’s xinhua news agency recently declared that beijing had a “responsibility to intervene when riots take place in hong kong” impatient with kania’s indecisive leadership and solidarity’s calls for more sweeping freedoms throughout the soviet bloc moscow engineered yet another shakeup in warsaw replacing him with general wojciech jaruzelski the new communist boss immediately called for an end to all strikes promising to take “extraordinary means of action” if he was disobeyed on december 13 1981 he did just that declaring martial law banning solidarity and arresting many of its leaders and activists jaruzelski argued that he chose the lesser of two evils by orchestrating a crackdown with polish troops and riot police he maintained he prevented a direct intervention by soviet forces the “purgatory” of martial law was absolutely necessary “to prevent us from ending in hell” as he put it to this day poles are split on whether they believe him since it views direct intervention as a last resort beijing may be sorely tempted to follow the polish example pressuring the hong kong authorities to act like jaruzelski if they go that route lam and her subordinates would almost certainly borrow a page from his “lesser of two evils” script and insist that they acted to avert direct intervention by china but there is good reason to question jaruzelski’s excuse for his actions in 1981—and there would be good reason to treat the rationale for a hong kong crackdown with similar skepticism  after solidarity triumphed and the polish communist regime collapsed in 1989 triggering the chain of events that led to the implosion of the soviet union two years later new evidence surfaced about what had really happened in 1992 mikhail gorbachev told the polish press agency “soviet forces were not to intervene in poland under any circumstances” in a transcript of a kremlin politburo meeting on october 29 1981 that was published in the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza kgb chief yuri andropov was quoted as saying “the polish leaders sometimes talk of military aid from fraternal states however we should decisively carry out our own policy—not sending in our troops to poland” defense minister dmitri ustinov echoed that view “our troops should not be sent into poland” he declared at a time when moscow was bogged down in its war in afghanistan and beset with economic disarray the last thing the enfeebled soviet leader leonid brezhnev wanted was to spark an allout fight with the troublesome poles but his leadership team deliberately conveyed the impression that they were ready to strike this gave jaruzelski the excuse to do their dirty work and make their direct intervention unnecessary no two historical situations are ever exactly alike but china’s leaders also want to avoid paying the price for a direct assault on hong kong’s protesters jeopardizing their economic achievements and geopolitical ambitions beijing like moscow in 1981 would prefer a peaceful solution if possible—or a local crackdown if it feels there is no alternative it sees direct intervention by its own forces as the last—and least desirable—outcome to that end beijing is warning that big brother is watching and ready to resort to force directly but in poland’s case then and china’s case now big brother did not and does not want that result all of which offers a small window of opportunity for hong kong today the protesters should recognize that like solidarity in poland they risk a major defeat if their actions spark a violent crackdown probably setting back their cause by at least several years but the communist authorities should recognize that even if they prevail by the use of force in the short term they may be inviting a far larger backlash in the future poland’s declaration of martial law did nothing to address the long list of legitimate grievances of its people in fact it forced the solidarity movement underground only to resurface with unstoppable momentum in 1989 chinese leaders always claim to be able to take the longterm view if they do so now they should recognize that they desperately need to come up with a nonviolent settlement—for their own good that will mean convincing the protesters that their aspirations will be treated seriously with all the key players invited to participate in crafting a genuine hong kong solution if china and hong kong’s leaders fail to do so poland’s example may prove far more prophetic than they are willing to imagine now  california   by jeremy b white   updated 050820 0944 pm edt    by sam sutton and

356,the dispute between egypt and ethiopia over the grand renaissance dam offers a unique chance to create a regional authority benefiting all 12 countries reliant on the river the nile is the longest river in the world but also the source of water for two great civilisations egypt is the epicentre of the oldest civilisation with a current population of 98 million people it is dependent on the nile for 97 of all water on exogenous flows  water originating outside its territorial borders  making it extremely vulnerable to upstream activities ethiopia is home to the orthodox church in africa with a civilisation dating back at least 2000 years and a current population of 105 million the blue nile is the largest contributor of water to the lower nile on which egypt is dependent but its source is fully within the geographic limits of ethiopia historically egypt has long been opposed to any development on the nile upstream that could curtail the amount of water it receives at the heart of the current issue are two massive dams one in a desert where stored water is lost to evaporation and seepage the other in the highlands where geology and topography provide storage with lower losses in terms of the energy aspects of these two dams both provide massive hydropower potential although the great renaissance dam can produce three times more energy than the aswan high dam can in a more reliable manner in essence then the conflict is about efficiencies of water storage and use versus national security fears arising from the inherent vulnerability associated with exogenous water at the heart of the dispute is the strategic importance of water energy and food security this is overlain by four critical issues  national security energy needed for industrialisation management of evaporative losses and tensions over the optimisation of system yield at national versus regional levels of control to understand the dispute its necessary to appreciate the way that each of these issues play out in the rhetoric and posturing of egypt and ethiopia as the two major actors in water constrained economies all economic development is curtailed this ultimately impacts on social stability so it becomes a national security issue this is certainly the case for egypt where national security concerns were triggered when french and british colonial rivalry saw an expeditionary force try to gain control of the headwaters of the nile in 1898 this fear was made more apparent when the first arabisraeli war of 1948 saw the egyptian revolutionary command council under gamal nasser call for the high dam covenant the essence of this covenant is for egypt to always have direct control of the nile most notably by storing more than double the annual flow of the river in the aswan high dam so powerful was this covenant that any person questioning the impact of the dam was deemed to be unpatriotic and ostracised the heart of the national security issue is strategic storage of water which must be retained in egyptian hands irrespective of the implication stated differently egypt has chosen to achieve national security by retaining direct control of water energy and food production within its sovereign sphere almost all countries choose to modernise their economies in response to the growing population this is certainly the case for both egypt and ethiopia with a combined population of 203 million early industrialisation in egypt was opposed by britain who favoured cotton production to supply their own textile industry this meant a tradeoff when the aswan high dam was built because water was needed for agriculture which meant that releases were timed to suit agricultural production this is at odds with energy production because the depth of the water determines the amount of energy that can be generated so while egypt has an installed capacity of 2100mw of power this is only achievable if water is not released for crop production this is not the case for ethiopia which has 6450mw of installed capacity that is not constrained by the intermittent need to release water for irrigation this brings into focus the strategic issue of water energy and food security by opening up the potential benefit of optimising the system at a level above that of the independent sovereign state stated differently the energy needed to create an industrial economy is not compatible with the water storage needs for purely agricultural production so egypt has a stark choice if it wishes to retain sovereign control over water and food security then it cannot generate enough energy to diversify its economy ethiopia on the other hand can generate energy for export to other countries in the region thereby diversifying its economy and creating food security through importation rather than domestic production there are two universal and inescapable realities for all dams in arid climates the first is that the larger the surface area of the dam the greater the losses of water to evaporation the second is that the surface area of the dam expressed as a function of total volume stored means that a deep dam built in a steepsided valley at elevation will always have lower evaporative losses when compared to a shallower dam built across a wider floodplain this is a critical issue because the more a river is dammed in a desert the greater the loss to evaporation and the lower the yield of the system for economic activity which brings us to the essence of the dispute between egypt and ethiopia it is not a dispute over the environmental impact of hydropowered energy because baseload energy requires a steady flow of water through the turbines with limited fluctuation to account for peak demand rather it is a dispute arising from the clash between water energy and food security at national level versus regional level egypt can still get its water from the blue nile once the grand renaissance dam has been filled so the issue is the rate of filling and not the energy production more importantly egypt will be guaranteed a baseflow down the blue nile which currently contributes about 23 of the total flow simply because ethiopia will be unable to close the sluices once the energy is flowing into a regional grid the argument that ethiopia can shut down the flow is illogical because that would undermine the very objective of the grand renaissance dam which is to generate energy for export to the region to reframe the debate the obstacle to be overcome is the assurance that egypt would receive greater benefits by relinquishing control over strategic storage to a location upstream in the basin to find an answer to this national security problem we need look to the lesotho highlands water scheme built during apartheid south african national security elites were fearful that lesotho could shut down the supply of water to the witwatersrand goldfields and the cities of johannesburg and pretoria this was overcome by clever engineering and design because the muela hydropower plant was located downstream of the katse dam but upstream of the point of delivery of water into south africa at liebenbergsvlei the whole idea was that if lesotho chose to shut down the delivery of water then their own energy supply would fail this was a form of mutually assured destruction a security concept central to nuclear deterrence the dispute between egypt and ethiopia over the grand renaissance dam offers a unique opportunity to reframe the water energy and food security dilemma facing governments with growing populations in an arid environment while it is desirable to create security in all three realms by monopolising control at national level the harsh reality is that this is simply not possible countries are locked into relationships with other sovereign states by virtue of their shared dependence on a river the nile locks in 12 countries some the poorest in africa and the flow of the river is such that by sharing water in any way that meets the needs of the downstream riparians  egypt and sudan  then food and energy security cannot also be guaranteed for other states close sign up for free allafrica

sharing is a recipe for longterm conflict because there is not enough in the river and the zerosum nature of the allocation implies a growing conflict potential a viable alternative has to be considered and this is best framed in a benefitsharing framework realistically water can be used more than once in each system so a plussum outcome is possible the generation of electricity in the headwaters does not reduce the stock of water available for downstream use this implies the need to cooperate at multilateral level to negotiate international agreements that are legally enforceable and even guaranteed by external agencies as required such an agreement would determine the rate at which the ethiopian dam can be filled as well as the minimum and maximum discharges needed to satisfy the legitimate security concerns that egypt has in effect then water energy and food security would be shifted from national level to a regional level managed within the context of a river basin authority representing all riparian states water and food security for egypt would be offset against the creation of energy security in ethiopia acting as the powerhouse for regional integration and

espouses an antius antinato and antiturkish   establishment ideology and has targeted us interests intermittently for   several decades most recently in february 2013 when a suicide bomber   targeted the us embassy in ankara killing a turkish security guard its   goals are the overthrow of the turkish state the removal of the us and   nato footprint from turkey and the abolition of one to threeman prison cells called ftype   prisons in turkey the us department of state in april 2014 offered   rewards for information on three dhkpc leaders through its rewards for   justice program in response dhkpc issued a statement calling the   united states its “chief enemy” dhkpc added suicide bombings to its tactics in 2001 with   successful attacks against the turkish police in addition to improvised   explosive devices and targeted assassinations increased attacks in   2003 probably were a reaction to turkey’s support of operation iraqi freedom dhkpc entered an operational lull until mid2012   when the group resumed attacks against turkish police targets   following the february 2013 us embassy attack dhkpc has continued   targeting turkish government and police interests indicating that the   group remained operationally viable despite crackdowns for example the   group on 31 march 2015 took hostage a turkish prosecutorâwho along with his captors was killed during a shootout with policeâand on 1 april attempted a failed suicide bombing targeting the turkish national police’s istanbul headquarters the kurdistan people’s congress kongragel   or kgk formerly the kurdistan workers’ party pkk is a kurdish   separatist group primarily active in part of northern iraq and   southeastern turkey composed mostly of turkish kurds the group in 1984   began a campaign of armed violence including terrorism which resulted   in over 45000 deaths kgk and turkish forces clashed repeatedly in   2011 and 2012 including an attack in october 2011 that killed 24   turkish troops and was the deadliest incident since 1993 kgk also   stepped up its kidnapping campaign against turkish state employees and   soldiers which included the unprecedented abduction of a turkish   parliamentary deputy in august 2012 the kgk’s imprisoned leader abdullah ocalan in 2012   entered into peace negotiations with the turkish government   negotiations continued into 2014 though kgk leaders expressed   frustration charging the turkish government failed to establish legal   and constitutional guarantees the accompanying ceasefire   endured despite clashes and tensions in southeast turkey sparked in part   by the construction of turkish military outposts that kurdish   supporters allege undercut the peace process clashes in july 2015 between turkish security forces and kgk resulted in   nationwide detentions of alleged kgk members and a wave of turkish   airstrikes against the group’s camps and weapons stores in   northern iraq renewed kgk violence against turkish authorities had   resulted in the deaths of at least 11 police and army members as of late   july 2015                                 national counterterrorism center note documents in portable

346,two swiss and french sinologists have differing views jean françois billeter contre françois jullien éditions allia paris 2006 122 pp in 2006 jean françois billeter b 1939 a swiss sinologist and professor emeritus at the university of geneva published his book contre françois jullien the translation of which would be arguments against françois jullien billeter criticises his french colleague jullien b 1951 a former professor at paris diderot university and the renowned sinologist’s interpretation of “chinese philosophy” or “chinese thought” la pensée chinoise  i how should one understand china or the socalled chinese way of thinking how does françois jullien see the country what irritates billeter about jullien’s theory and why does this matter how does jullien understand china one of the main ideas in billeter’s critique of jullien’s approach to china is that the frenchman’s numerous frenchlanguage works on china are based on the “myth of alterity of china”  sic   mythe de l’altérité de la chine  jullien’s china is “a world completely different from ours indeed opposed to it” by “us” jullien means the west—a term which i find it necessary to explain has its own history of formation and strategies of use but analysing these would take more space than this article has to offer according to jullien’s theory chinese philosophy or chinese thought ii is the antipode of ours the west’s what does jullien consider the main difference between western and chinese philosophy the key word here is immanence —for jullien chinese thought is mainly characterised by this term in english “immanence” means the state of being present as a natural and permanent part of something iii jullien sees chinese philosophy not only the work of philosophers but also the way an ordinary chinese person thinks as a separate phenomenon having no need for anything from “the outside” billeter explains that according to jullien’s theory chinese philosophy senses or comprehends  conçoit  reality as follows chinese reality is “moving  mouvante  and led by a certain dynamic inherent in this reality the dynamic holds tendencies or trends  tendances  transformations and returns  retournements  which submit to the inner logic of this reality” iv meaning china has its own system of reality and internal logic untouched by foreign influence the role of a chinese person is to figure out how to get by inside the system the most effectively they cannot question why the system is as it is let alone consider changing it but must understand how to serve the system as best they can and make it work to their own benefit their role in this internal reality is to “sense and predict the aforementioned tendenciestrends transformations and returns to adapt to them make the situation work to their own benefit and pinpoint the opportunities which would help achieve great results with minimal resources” explains jullien v he specifies that in a world shaped and built in this way “there is no need for end goals  buts en soi  fins dernières  absolute values  valeurs absolues  a priori truths theoretic ideas  idées pures  the rule of the ‘intelligible’ outside the domain of the ‘perceptible’”  règne de l’intelligible extérieur au domaine du sensible  nor theory ahead of practice there is no need for “root causes  causes premières  creation  création  god the creator  dieu créateur  beginning of the world  commencement absolu  etc” in contrast to the west “transcendence” or “going beyond over to the other side” or “reality imperceptible to human experience” does not exist in this world jullien associates transcendence with the west and immanence with china the west transcends the limitations of its world but china does not as everything it needs exists in its world and is internal what disturbs billeter about jullien’s views jullien’s interpretation of chinese philosophy or philosophy of immanence  la pensée de l’immanence  is a scholastically valuable approach as billeter admits nevertheless billeter does not agree with jullien exploring chinese philosophy separate from the political and historical context of china and the world billeter explains françois jullien talks about chinese thinkers as if they had always agreed as a group just because they were chinese and as if their thought  leur pensée  never displayed any aporia illusion hidden ambition motivated lies cold will to restrain people’s spirit nor doubt mental clarity braveness courage … hence jullien denies any link between chinese philosophy and history as if chinese thought were some mystical phenomenon outside chinese history and their politicians’ agendas billeter agrees with the term “immanence” and appreciates its value in understanding how a chinese person functions in the chinese system—without asking why and looking for tools and opportunities to be more effective then again billeter stresses that in his books jullien does not pose the question why such a philosophy of immanence exists what historical processes and political interests have shaped the chinese way of thinking let us go back in time imperial china is said to have been founded in 221 bc after the fall of the qin dynasty in 202 bc the han came to power their aim was to avoid the mistakes of their predecessors and do everything to maintain authority  this worked out well and the dynasty stayed in power for four centuries until 220 ad but what is more important is that the empire lasted until 1911 how could an empire survive for more than two millennia what was the secret to the strength of the system “emperors their advisers and representatives instrumentalised culture they rebuilt it from scratch and based the new regime on this very culture” billeter explains the empire had to become something completely natural and logical for the chinese people to achieve this the system was formed around the central idea that “the emperor’s rule complies with the rules of the universe forever” “all fields of knowledge philosophy and thought language  portrayals and performances  représentations  had to assure the chinese that the emperor’s rule is natural in its essence” this was the most effective way to ensure the longevity of the imperial order and maintain hierarchy domination and submission according to billeter chinese civilisation as it is now viewed in china and abroad was born through the “instrumentalisation of culture so as to maintain authority” it was created from the wish to keep the emperor in power on the one hand the aim of the imperial order was to conceal the power as such so that the public would not realise that the regime was oppressive while on the other it was to eliminate all imaginable alternatives to oppression hence the chinese people had to feel that imperialism was natural and not question it an important keyword is “confucianisation” which began during the han dynasty but reached its peak intensity only during the ming 1368–1644 and qing 1644–1911 dynasties the imperial order used confucius to justify oppression and maintain authority attributing an erudite façade and historical background to its rule with the help of confucian teachings confucian moral values state that a person has a certain position in society and hierarchal relations between parent and child man and woman elders and the young leaders and subordinates different social classes and so on must be firmly maintained citing li dongjun billeter explains how advisers to han emperors developed the socalled “cult of unity”  culte de l’ un—a strictly hierarchal system of social relations in which everyone has a defined place and class or even rank determined obligations to submit to those above and the right to dominate those below this system demands certain skills and abilities from a person to fulfil these obligations everyone in their position has the responsibility to maintain harmony within the unity  hence in practice every person has full responsibility over the whole system this calls for denying the individual in favour of the whole the use of imperial confucianism as a political weapon to harness power is clearly far from confucius’s initial philosophy billeter criticises jullien for not placing immanence in the political and historical context described above for him jullien did not see that the socalled chinese way of thinking or philosophy of immanence is a part of the world in which objectives  la question des fins  are not part of the discussion they are not questioned and “intelligence” is manifested in cleverly choosing tools methods and actions and adapting to the situation as is  jullien did not see that the philosophy of immanence was formed in connection with the imperial order as imperialism “created a closedup world solving the question of objectives with authoritarian means” according to billeter we cannot speak of goals in such a world as this world unitedly serves a purpose that cannot be questioned power  jullien idealises chinese philosophy citing the chinese thinkers who do not understand that they are writing in the context of a closed world and cannot see the historical reasons for this reclusion then again he ignores the thinkers who are critical of this order why does this matter following the story of a region like china or estonia or any other country we must focus on the subliminal reasons behind people’s actions the political and historical context billeter emphasises that a person’s actions thinking and way of rationalising the world never exist outside their own context incidentally in the second half of the 19th century “confucianism” was also applied in the process of modernising japan in her dissertation célia sakurai a brazilian anthropologist describes how in the 19th century “confucianism” was instrumentalised in japan to legitimise the emperor’s rule sakurai explains that in confucian thought a person must strive for harmony and one of the values to help people reach harmony is to accept what fate has put in that person’s hands—ie to accept the emperor’s rule the logic is similar in china and japan to sum up if people are acting a certain way in a region and one wants to understand why one might ask how is authority exercised in this area who benefits from people acting or sensing the world this way,3

54,main menu seth g jones  share via     abstract with the onset of interafghan peace talks it is important to take a close look at the taliban—including their main objectives ideological underpinnings organizational structure military strategies and tactics and relationship with state and nonstate actors the taliban is in many ways a different organization from the one that governed afghanistan in the 1990s yet most of their leaders are nevertheless committed to an extreme interpretation of islam that is not shared by many afghans an autocratic political system that eschews democracy and the persistence of relations with terrorist groups like alqaida these realities cast serious doubt about the possibility of a lasting peace agreement with the afghan government in the near future on september 15 2020 representatives from the taliban and afghan government gathered in doha qatar to begin facetoface peace negotiations foreign leaders attending in person and by video conference lauded the start of peace talks as a historic moment1 but the taliban’s reaction was more subdued the taliban’s senior negotiator mawlawi abdul hakim haqqani sat hunched in his chair in the grand ballroom hardly looking at the video screen and refusing to put on a translation headset even though the speeches were in english a language he does not speak2 perhaps the taliban had a point the history of intrastate wars is littered with failed peace attempts3 since world war ii nearly threequarters of insurgencies have ended because of a military victory by the government or insurgent side on the battlefield and only a quarter have ended because of political negotiations or other factors4 afghanistan itself is a graveyard of failed peace talks5 these challenges raise important questions among the most important—and the focus of this article—are the following who are the taliban today what are their main objectives ideological underpinnings organizational structure military strategies and tactics and relationships with state and nonstate actors based on answers to these questions what are the implications for peace negotiations an agreement with the taliban that ends the war and decreases the possibility that afghanistan will once again become a sanctuary for international terrorism would be a welcome development it would end several decades of war that has killed over 157000 people including 43000 civilians in afghanistan created massive suffering among its population and decimated its economy6 it would also allow the united states and other countries to withdraw their military forces and reduce their military and other foreign assistance after all the united states has deployed combat forces to afghanistan for nearly two decades including a peak of over 100000 us troops spent over 800 billion in military expenditures and development assistance between 2001 and 2019 and suffered over 2300 soldiers killed7 around the globe and at home there are more pressing problems from countering and recovering from covid19 to competing with major powers like china and russia as this article argues however a close look at the taliban today suggests that their leaders remain committed to an extreme religious ideology an authoritarian political system and the continuation of relations with militant groups that will not likely be acceptable to the current afghan government many afghans and many foreign governments in addition the united states announced on november 17 2020 that it would reduce its force posture in afghanistan from 4500 to 2500 troops8 these realities make a lasting peace agreement with the afghan government unlikely in the near future in this author’s view a precipitous us withdrawal without a peace agreement between the taliban and afghan government would be highly destabilizing and would ultimately undermine us national security interests to examine the taliban today the rest of this article is divided into several sections the first outlines the taliban’s ideology and objectives including in historical context the second section examines the taliban’s organizational structure the third analyzes the taliban’s military strategy and tactics the fourth section explores the taliban’s relationship with other militant groups including alqaida the fifth assesses the taliban’s links with the governments of other countries such as pakistan iran and russia finally the sixth section outlines implications of this analysis for peace talks and the future of afghanistan ideology and objectives the taliban’s ideology is deeply rooted in hanafi school of islamic jurisprudence9 while the ideology of the taliban has been evolving since the movement’s establishment in the 1990s taliban leaders today generally support the establishment of a government by sharia ‘islamic’ law and the creation of an “islamic emirate” in afghanistan10 the taliban elevate the role of islamic scholars ulema that issue legal rulings fatwas on all aspects of daily life the ulema play a particularly important role in monitoring society’s conformity with their view of the prescriptions of islam and in conservatively interpreting religious doctrine11 the taliban has also been described as a “nationalist” movement in the sense that their leaders advocate for an “islamic emirate” in afghanistan rather than as part of a broader pan‘islamic’ caliphate12 one of the most useful documents to understand taliban ideology is the layha or code of conduct which has been updated several times13 it outlines the rules of behavior for taliban members based on the movements core ‘islamic’ principles armed jihad has been an integral means for the taliban to establish an “islamic emirate” along with education and preaching or da’wa14 for taliban leaders armed jihad is obligatory for all muslims particularly afghans and must be undertaken against all enemies of islam taliban leaders have been particularly adamant about armed jihad to coerce the withdrawal of us and other international forces15 for example taliban propaganda celebrated the february 2020 deal with the united states as a major victory and urged supporters to continue armed jihad in publications on their website—appropriately called “voice of jihad”—even as taliban leaders discussed the start of peace negotiations16 in march 2020 a number of taliban field commanders informed civilian populations that following the withdrawal of us forces they were confident of the “victory of the islamic emirate” and that the “afghan government would be toppled within three months” through armed jihad17 in addition the taliban’s ideology includes an important component of pashtunwali an evolving system of customary law culture and conflict resolution followed by many ethnic pashtun tribes in afghanistan and pakistan18 pashtun tribal structure has undergone dramatic changes over the past several decades of war and local versions of pashtunwali or nirkh can differ significantly across areas19 local militia commanders have sometimes usurped the power of tribal leaders nevertheless taliban commanders have adopted some components of pashtunwali the taliban strictly segregates the sexes a practice known as purdah and an afghan man’s honor or nang is closely tied to how the women of his family are treated the taliban’s views are more popular in conservative rural areas of afghanistan including pashtun areas20 as one assessment concluded the taliban movement “is characterized by horizontal networklike structures that reflect its strong roots in the segmented pashtun tribal society”21 but the taliban has expanded its support in areas of the country with fewer pashtuns such as the north and west22 during the taliban’s time in power from the mid1990s to 2001 the movement enforced a stringent interpretation of the islamic dress code for men and women23 the taliban mandated that all men grow beards and refrain from wearing western clothes the taliban closed cinemas and prohibited music24 the taliban banned almost every conceivable kind of entertainment such as television videos cards kiteflying and most sports—except ironically public executions in kabul’s main soccer stadium the taliban also defaced and destroyed hundreds of cultural artifacts that it called polytheistic including museums and private art collections perhaps the most outrageous was the taliban’s destruction of the buddha statues in the afghan city of bamiyan in march 2001 taliban fighters used dynamite to demolish the statues which had stood for nearly 2000 years the taliban’s first leader mullah mohammad omar defended such actions by saying they were orchestrated to protect the purity of islam25 more recently the taliban has moderated its views on some issues such as the education of girls and the use of modern technology and digital platforms26 taliban deputy leader sirajuddin haqqani wrote in february 2020 that the taliban would “build an islamic system in which all afghans have equal rights where the rights of women that are granted by islam—from the right to education to the right to work—are protected”27 but the taliban has a welldocumented record of repression intolerance and human rights abuses against women foreigners ethnic minorities and journalists28 the taliban’s persecution of women is particularly concerning women who are victims of domestic violence have little recourse to justice in taliban courts and the taliban discourages women from working denies women access to modern healthcare prohibits women from participating in politics and supports such punishments against women as stoning and public lashing29 since 2001 when the united states helped overthrow the taliban regime the taliban’s objectives have generally been consistent to coerce through military force or political negotiations the withdrawal of us and other international forces from afghanistan overthrow the government in kabul and replace it with an “islamic emirate”30 in a march 2020 speech to taliban military commanders in pakistan senior taliban figure mullah fazl insisted that the movement was committed to establishing an “islamic emirate” based on the taliban’s interpretation of sharia31 while there are different views of what a future taliban government might look like a number of prominent taliban leaders support the creation of an authoritarian high council of religious scholars and perhaps an unelected emir—somewhat akin to a sunni version of the islamic republic of iran32 taliban leaders have never accepted the post2001 afghan state which they view as a “puppet” or “stooge” of the west that relies on foreign money and troops33 most taliban leaders also reject the 2004 afghan constitution as illegitimate in part because they argue it was not adequately grounded in sharia34 in addition taliban leaders generally disparage democracy as a corrupt invention of the west and dismiss as shams the elections held in afghanistan since 2001 their logic is that only allah can appoint leaders—not humans who they say tend to vote for corrupt and illegitimate figures as one taliban document summarized with a dash of sarcasm “democracy will only bring an islamic system if angels descend from the heavens and cast their votes in ballot boxes people cast their votes in favor of oppressors and wild people”35 taliban support appears to be notably weaker in urban areas where the afghan population is more progressive and disinclined to support the taliban’s extremist views some public opinion polling suggests that the taliban’s ideology is still too extreme for many afghans—including urban afghans—who adhere to a much less conservative form of islam and thus take a more progressive approach to social media  music television political participation and rights for women36 in addition the ideological views of taliban leaders are not shared by all taliban members and sympathizers instead they support the taliban because of a variety of factors including afghan police abuses and harassment civilian casualties caused by foreign forces money unhappiness with the afghan government and the presence of foreign forces37 there have been divisions within the movement as there are with virtually every insurgent group first there have been disagreements about the wisdom and specifics of peace negotiations some taliban leaders have supported negotiations such as mullah ghani baradar while others have been more skeptical such as sher mohammad abbas stanekzai while the ongoing peace negotiations have not caused major defections—at least not yet—some disaffected taliban established the hizbi vilayet islami islamic governorate party in response38 second there is a long history of conflict between and among protaliban tribes and subtribes in afghanistan such as some members of the alizai and noorzai tribes in southern afghanistan39 third there has been discontent among some taliban commanders who believe that taliban leaders are out of touch with the hardships in afghanistan since they live comfortable lifestyles in pakistan and qatar40 fourth there has been notable dissent about the taliban’s relationship with various state and nonstate actors including pakistan russia and iran according to a taliban member interviewed by two western scholars some taliban oppose the group’s relations with russia since they consider moscow a historical “murderer of the afghan nation” and resent shia iran because “it will never be a friend of the afghan people”41 fifth there have been ideological and other divisions within the taliban over civilian casualties the legitimacy of suicide bombing corruption poor leadership among some local commanders and other issues42 organizational structure to accomplish its main objectives the taliban has established a relatively centralized organizational structurea since world war ii the vast majority of insurgent groups 91 percent have set up centralized structures largely because such structures are more effective in dealing with “principalagent” problems43 a principal an insurgent leader needs to set in place a system of incentives and penalties so that an agent a rankandfile member of the group will perform as the principal expects44 principalagent problems are particularly important to prevent such steps as “shirking” and defections especially when lowerlevel operatives have different preferences and motivations from senior leaders an insurgent engages in shirking behavior by acting in inefficient ways such as idling with friends rather than burying an improvised explosive device before a government convoy drives through the area45 centralization is also helpful for groups like the taliban in governing territory since it minimizes the likelihood that local cells can usurp power and resources for their own interests46 at the top of the taliban’s organizational structure is the rahbari shura or leadership council which is outlined in figure 1 the body is often colloquially referred to as the quetta shura because some of its members and their families live in—and around—the pakistan city of quetta47 the taliban also has regional shuras in pakistan’s peshawar and miranshah beginning around 2007 the taliban established a shura in mashhad iran the mashhad shura to oversee operations in western afghanistan with the aid of the iranian government’s islamic revolutionary guard corpsquds force irgcqf48 the rahbari shura does not exercise unfettered control over the regional shuras and rankandfile members there have been tensions between the quetta shura and those in peshawar for example over commandandcontrol arrangements funding and personality clashes49 the taliban is led by mawlawi haibatullah akhunzada who was appointed emir after the united states killed his predecessor mullah akhtar mansour in a may 2016 drone strike akhunzada is a cleric with no serious military experience50 while akhunzada is the organization’s leader the taliban rules by consensus among members of its rahbari shura the shura is primarily composed of pashtuns from eastern and southern afghanistan though it does have some nonpashtun figures including uzbeks51 to help run the organization the taliban has several commissions komisiuns as highlighted in figure 2 these commissions which are based in pakistan are critical to performing the key tasks of running an insurgency and governing territory after all insurgency is a process of alternative state building where insurgents provide governance to the population in areas they control53 leaders want to extract what they can from noncombatants to sustain their groups such as information food housing and supplies groups need to establish organizational structures that can secure funds through taxation and other means organize policing administer justice and provide health benefits including care to wounded fighters54 the taliban’s primary commissions allow them to perform these tasks including overseeing military strategy military commission running an extensive propaganda enterprise media commission raising funds commission for financial affairs and overseeing peace negotiations political commission at the operational and tactical levels the taliban has established shadow governors and military commanders at the provincial district and local levels in afghanistan in february 2020 rahbari shura members met to discuss new appointments in eastern southern and northern afghanistan as the taliban reorganized their shadow government structure56 taliban governance—including its courts—has sometimes been effective local afghan police in provinces such as helmand for example have handed over suspects to the taliban to be tried at their “shadow” religious courts because they believe the outcome would be quicker and fairer than if they sent them to the district center57 the taliban’s commission for financial affairs plays an important role in securing funding for the group the taliban receives money from the cultivation production and trafficking of opium the taliban has allowed drugsmuggling syndicates known as tanzeems to operate in return for a portion of their profit58 in addition the taliban has profited from methamphetamine production and trafficking and they reportedly control nearly twothirds of the methamphetamine laboratories in farah and nimroz provinces in western afghanistan59 estimates of the taliban’s overall revenues range from 300 million to roughly 15 billion per year60 one of the rahbari shura’s key sources of financing comes from outside states such as pakistan iran russia and wealthy donors in the gulf61 the taliban secure funding in a range of ways such as road taxes ushr and zakatb in addition they levy taxes on infrastructure utilities and agriculture under their influence or control the taliban have also secured funding through extortion against mobile telephone and electricity companies as well as received money from the illegal extraction of onyx marble tin aragonite gold rare earth minerals copper and zinc62 military strategy and tactics to achieve their objectives taliban leaders have conducted a guerrilla campaign and emphasized the importance of armed jihad a guerrilla strategy includes the utilization of ambushes raids and other hitandrun attacks to weaken a government’s political will to fight63 the primary goal of a guerrilla strategy is to defeat the will of the government by mobilizing the civilian population undermining government support and raising the costs of continued fighting it is not necessarily to defeat the capacity of its adversary to fight a guerrilla strategy is often palatable to insurgent groups that are significantly weaker than their adversaries which is why a guerrilla campaign is sometimes likened to a “war of the flea”64 taliban leaders have generally eschewed a conventional military strategy the goal of a conventional strategy is to win the war in a series of battles by destroying the adversary’s physical capacity to resist65 unlike a guerrilla strategy a conventional strategy focuses on defeating the security forces of the government and its international backers66 in 2006 the taliban briefly attempted a conventional strategy in an effort to overrun kandahar city by massing forces as omer lavoie the commander of canada’s task force 306 battle group explained “for the last six months i trained my battle group to fight a counterinsurgency and now find that we are facing something a lot more like conventional warfare”67 in response us canadian and other allied forces conducted operation medusa which successfully prevented the taliban from seizing and holding kandahar city68 more recently the taliban have conducted some operations in larger formations against static afghan forces including in kunar nuristan kunduz badakhshan and wardak provinces69 the threat of us air support and us special operations forces has generally deterred the taliban from conducting a conventional strategy however the taliban would likely switch to a conventional strategy—at least in some areas—with the withdrawal of us and other international military forces in waging guerrilla warfare the taliban’s military structure includes provincial and district military commanders including those at the following levels large front loy mahaz front mahaz group grup and team dilghay70 among the most effective and innovative taliban units has been the sare qeta red units which are roughly equivalent to special operations forces trained to operate in small groups71 though their organizational structure is fairly centralized the taliban do allow local commanders to have some autonomy at the operational and tactical levels—including regarding military operations financing and recruitment72 overall the number of fulltime taliban fighters ranges from low estimates of 55000 to higher estimates of 85000 fighters though the number of taliban facilitators and intelligence operatives likely brings the total estimate to over 100000 personnel73 despite us afghan and other international targeting of taliban fighters over the years the group has nevertheless been successful in recruiting new members as one taliban recruiter remarked it’s not easy being in the taliban it’s like wearing a jacket of fire you have to leave your family and live with the knowledge that you can be killed at any time … you can’t expect any quick medical treatment if you’re wounded you don’t have any money yet when i tell new recruits what they are facing they still freely put on this jacket of fire74 at the tactical level the taliban rely on ambushes raids assassinations and bombings against the afghan government and foreign forces taliban fighters utilize weapons ideal for guerrilla warfare such as kalashnikov assault rifles dschk heavy machine guns rpg7 rocket launchers 107mm field rocket launchers 145mm antiaircraft machine guns improvised explosive devices heavy mortars 122mm rockets and advanced antiarmor weaponry75 as figure 3 highlights in 2020 the taliban conducted attacks—especially directfire attacks—throughout the country highlighting the group’s ability to strike a wide range of urban and rural targets taliban units conducted bombings and assassinations in virtually every major afghan city such as kabul kandahar and kunduz76 in addition taliban fighters conducted sustained violence against afghan army and police fixed positions set up checkpoints on some major roads and seized some district centers such as in yamgan district badakhshan province in march 202077 c the taliban have also caused the majority of civilian casualties in afghanistan largely because of their utilization of pressureplate improvised explosive devices78 to complement military operations taliban leaders have long recognized the importance of propaganda as one taliban media official acknowledged “wars today cannot be won without media … if the media can defeat the heart then the body is defeated too and the battle is won”79 the taliban’s information campaign relies on traditional tools like shabnamah night letters taranas chants poems khutba friday sermons graffiti printed materials and other mediums the taliban also use radio broadcasts text messages social media sites like facebook and twitter and websites to issue propaganda80 while the taliban have succeeded in waging a sustained campaign against the united states and its partners for nearly two decades they have faced serious setbacks they have failed to seize and hold any major cities in afghanistan the taliban attempted to capture kunduz city in 2015 but could not maintain control of the city taliban fighters also entered farah city in february and may 2018 but again could not hold the city this failure to hold urban terrain marks a notable difference from some other insurgent groups including the islamic state82 in syria and iraq for example the islamic state seized and held several cities for a significant length of time such as raqqa mosul fallujah and ramadi instead the afghan government’s security forces maintain the majority of control of kabul provincial capitals and most of the main roads though the taliban have threatened and occasionally seized some district centers83 in fact the number of districts under taliban control slightly decreased between 2019 and mid202084 us and afghan forces have killed numerous taliban commanders such as mullah abdul bari the shadow governor for farah province in august 2019 haji lala the shadow governor for logar in june 2019 and wali jan aka hamza the shadow governor for wardak in april 202085 in addition the taliban have struggled with corruption criminal activity and human rights abuses from some of their commanders forcing them to establish a series of layha code of conduct to govern the organization86 the taliban’s commitment to armed jihad has been consistent since the movement’s establishment in the 1990s yet while the taliban have sustained an insurgency against the afghan government and been a formidable opponent they have failed to control major urban centers this reality suggests that—at least at the moment—the taliban are strong enough to fight the afghan government and its international backers to a rough stalemate but too weak to hold populated areas and overthrow the government relationship with nonstate actors in the february 2020 agreement between the taliban and the united states the taliban agreed to prevent alqaida and other terrorist groups from using afghan territory to threaten the united states and its partners87 yet the available evidence indicates that the taliban retain close ties with alqaida and several other groups relations between the taliban and alqaida have lasted for nearly two and a half decades88 after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the taliban refused to hand over usama bin ladin to the united states today the taliban retain close relations with alqaida including its local affiliate alqaida in the indian subcontinent aqis as a 2020 us department of defense assessment concluded “despite recent progress in the peace process aqis maintains close ties to the taliban in afghanistan likely for protection and training”89 contacts between alqaida and the haqqani network—including the taliban’s deputy leader sirajuddin haqqani—remain particularly close they share longstanding personal relationships intermarriage a shared history of struggle and sympathetic ideologies90 still the taliban and alqaida have different ideologies and taliban leaders remain focused on establishing an “islamic emirate” in afghanistan—not the creation of a pan‘islamic’ caliphate91 the periodic meetings between taliban and alqaida leaders are one example of a persistent relationship in the spring of 2019 senior taliban leaders reportedly met with alqaida’s hamza bin ladin the son of usama bin ladin in the sarwan qal’ah district of helmand province to personally reassure him that the taliban would never break links with alqaida—including as part of a peace deal in addition members of the haqqani network reportedly met with alqaida leader ayman alzawahiri in february 2020 to discuss a range of issues including implications of a possible peace agreement according to un estimates senior alqaida leaders met with taliban officials at least a half dozen times between may 2019 and may 202092 this continuing relationship is not surprising alqaida leaders have pledged loyalty baya to every taliban leader since the group’s establishment from mullah muhammad omar to mullah akhtar mansour and mawlawi haibatullah akhunzada for example usama bin ladin remarked that the taliban “are fighting america and its agents under the leadership of the commander of the believers mullah omar may allah protect him”93 bin ladin may have pledged baya to ensure that afghans saw the insurgency as being led by afghan mujahideen and not by foreign arabs according to one account around 2010 taliban leader tayeb agha traveled from quetta to deliver a personal message to usama bin ladin which indicated that “if we—when we—return to power in afghanistan” alqaida “will have to maintain a very low profile”94 following bin ladin’s death in 2011 the taliban praised him as a martyr that had fought “with great honesty and bravery shoulder to shoulder with the afghans”95 in august 2015 ayman alzawahiri pledged baya to newly announced taliban leader mullah akhtar mohammad mansour “i as the emir of al qaida present to you our pledge of allegiance renewing the method of sheikh osama and his brothers the pure martyrs” alzawahiri said96 in june 2016 alzawahiri similarly pledged allegiance to mansour’s successor mawlawi haibatullah akhunzada “we pledge allegiance to you on jihad to liberate every inch of the lands of the muslims that are invaded and stolen—from kashgar to alandalus from the caucasus to somalia and central africa from kashmir to jerusalem from the philippines to kabul and from bukhara to samarkand”97 d overall there are likely less than 1000 alqaida operatives in afghanistan with some estimates between 400 and 600 militants98 core alqaida leaders believed to be in afghanistan—or in the vicinity of the afghanistanpakistan border—included alzawahiri ahmad alqatari sheikh abdul rahman and abu osman us and afghan forces killed some alqaida leaders in afghanistan in october 2020 for example afghan special operations forces killed a senior alqaida official hossam abdul alraouf who used the nom de guerre abu muhsin almasri who had been sheltered by local taliban commanders in ghazni province99 while alqaida is not a major part of the insurgency alqaida fighters have still engaged in military operations in support of the taliban in at least a dozen afghan provinces—including badakhshan ghazni helmand khost kunar kunduz logar nangarhar nimruz nuristan paktiya and zabul100 on december 11 2019 for example alqaida allegedly conducted an attack against us and other forces at bagram airfield operatives detonated car bombs and then launched a multipronged attack killing two people and wounding over 70 others101 in may 2019 aqis released a video claiming an attack against afghan forces in paktika province in eastern afghanistan102 in september 2019 us and afghan forces targeted a taliban and alqaida meeting in the shabaroz area of musa qal’ah district helmand province they killed asim umar aqis’s leader as well as six others—including the group’s courier to ayman alzawahiri103 in march 2020 one of alqaida’s media arms thabat released summaries of its global operations including hundreds of alleged attacks in afghanistan that month104 e in addition to alqaida the taliban has coordinated with other international and regional militant groups such as the tehrikitaliban pakistan jaishemohammed and lashkaretaiba105 most of the fighters from these groups are located in eastern provinces like kunar nangarhar and nuristan where they cooperate with local taliban commanders106 in addition there are other militant groups in the afghanistanpakistan border region that cooperate with local taliban commanders such as some networks of the eastern turkistan islamic movement islamic movement of uzbekistan and lashkareislam107 one of the militant groups not aligned with the taliban is the islamic state’s local branch the islamic state in iraq and the levantkhorasan isilk there are roughly 2200 isilk fighters in afghanistan many of which are located in kunar province especially tsowkey district108 islamic state publications have repeatedly criticized the taliban’s willingness to negotiate peace with the united states as heretical and portrayed their ideology as corrupt109 isilk has conducted mass casualty attacks in afghanistan though it has suffered significant attrition and lost control of territory in such areas as nangarhar province110 afghan forces captured its leader aslam farooqi and several other commanders such as qari zahid and saifullah in kandahar province in march 2020111 while the taliban has fought isilk fighters in afghanistan the taliban continues to cooperate with regional and international terrorist groups like alqaida jaishemohammed and lashkaretaiba the taliban’s relationship with these groups has been deep and historical making it unlikely that they will break ties this reality has significant implications for the united states it is conceivable—perhaps even likely—that afghanistan could once again become a sanctuary for international terrorist groups if the united states pulled out all forces from afghanistan without an interafghan peace deal outside state support one of the most important reasons the taliban have persisted is their ability to secure outside assistance from states the taliban receive support from their primary state backer pakistan as well as from iran and russia pakistan—especially the country’s most powerful spy agency the interservices intelligence isi directorate—has aided the taliban since their rise in afghanistan part of pakistan’s impetus is likely the continuing conflict with india and islamabad’s fear—as one pakistan government official explained to the author—of a “double squeeze” by new delhi from both india and afghanistan112 india remains a major ally of the government in kabul isi’s directorate that aids the taliban has been led by a series of competent general officers such as major general muhammad waseem ashraf113 over the past decade the isi and other pakistan agencies have provided money equipment intelligence strategic guidance and—perhaps most importantly—sanctuary to the taliban114 as already noted the taliban’s rahbari shura and several of their most important regional shuras—such as the peshawar and miranshah shuras—are located in pakistan several leaders of the taliban and the haqqani network—such as mullah akhtar mansour and badruddin haqqani—were killed in pakistan by us strikes in addition much of the taliban’s propaganda production infrastructure has been located in pakistan including media production facilities like alemarah and al hijrat the monthly pamphlet srak beam of light and such magazines as al somood resistance in fight shahamat courage elhan inspiration and murchal trench115 yet pakistan’s relationship with the taliban—including senior taliban leaders—has sometimes been testy in february 2010 for example isi arrested mullah ghani baradar after he discussed the possibility of peace negotiations with afghan president hamid karzai without consulting islamabad baradar’s actions had also infuriated other taliban leaders such as abdul qayum zakir and abdul majid116 more broadly pakistan support to the taliban has caused some problems for the militant group such as creating a perception among some afghans that it is a stooge of the isi in addition to pakistan iran has aided the taliban—particularly the islamic revolutionary guard corpsquds force irgcqf the paramilitary arm of the irgc iran is likely motivated by a desire to remove the us military presence from afghanistan develop relations with the taliban as it plays a more important political role in the country and weaken the islamic state117 iran has established close relations with such taliban leaders as abdul qayum zakir mullah ghani baradar and the deceased mullah akhtar mansour118 iran has also provided sanctuary for some senior alqaida officials such as saif aladl in the years since 911119 iran has provided money weapons such as kalashnikovs and longrange sniper rifles materiel such as explosives remotecontrol technology for ieds and night vision goggles logistics and training to the taliban—including at camps in iran120 but iranian aid has been limited and it has not likely provided surfacetoair missiles or other advanced weapons to the taliban or other afghan groups the irgcqf also helped the taliban establish a shura in mashhad to oversee operations in western afghanistan as well as offices in zahidan and sistan iran121 these taliban hubs in iran allowed the organization to plan operations train and move weapons and materiel into afghanistan—including such provinces as nimruz farah herat and badghis—outside the reach of the us and afghan governments122 the irgcqf and hezbollah also worked with afghan fighters in syria including afghans who were part of the fatemeyoun division—a unit of mostly shia afghan fighters that conducted operations in syria under iranian command123 russia has also provided some aid to the taliban though moscow supports peace talks as well124 moscow is likely motivated by a desire to expand russian influence on its southern flank in central and south asia secure the withdrawal of us military forces counter islamic state operations and cultivate influence within the taliban in case they return to power125 russian support to the taliban is not new around 2016 russia began to provide limited assistance to the taliban including small arms and money according to us government assessments126 in addition the russian military allegedly encouraged and offered money to talibanlinked militants in afghanistan to target foreign forces including possibly us troops127 russian actions were likely the handiwork of unit 29155—a shadowy division of russia’s military intelligence agency known as the gru tasked with foreign assassinations and other covert activities us intelligence agencies had monitored financial transfers from a bank account controlled by the gru and then watched as it was dispersed through a complex hawala system—an informal way to transfer money—to taliban militants in early 2020 us forces and afghan operatives from the afghan intelligence agency the national directorate for security had raided a taliban compound in afghanistan and recovered roughly 500000 in us currency and other materiel that raised suspicion of russian activity some of this information was summarized in a president’s daily brief provided to us president donald trump around february 27 2020 in a july 2020 intelligence community memo the cia and national counterterrorism center assessed with medium confidence that gru unit 29155 had offered aid to taliban operatives to possibly target us and other international soldiers128 in sum outside state support has been critical to the taliban as has financial support from some wealthy gulf donors129 it has allowed the taliban to retain neighboring sanctuaries—especially in pakistan—and to maintain a relatively steady supply of money weapons and materiel implications of a peace deal a peace agreement between the afghan government and the taliban that ends over four decades of nearconstant war in afghanistan would be a remarkable achievement negotiators from the afghan government taliban united states europe pakistan and other countries need to continue to support peace talks while this article does not provide a comprehensive assessment of the negotiations including the bargaining positions of all sides it does raise several issues regarding the taliban that cast doubt about the likelihood of successful interafghan talks in the near future first the taliban’s goal of establishing an extreme version of sharia in afghanistan under the rubric of an “islamic emirate” is incompatible with the views of the current afghan government many though not all afghans and western governments despite promises to the contrary the taliban has perpetrated substantial human rights violations and oppression against women ethnic minorities journalists international aid workers and others second most taliban leaders eschew democracy as a corrupt foreign political system instead many have advocated the establishment of an authoritarian high council of religious scholars and figures with sweeping authority and an unelected emir or leader in place of the current government in kabul—somewhat akin to a sunni version of iran third the taliban continue to cooperate with alqaida and other terrorist organizations to help sustain operations the taliban are aided by sanctuary in pakistan support from pakistan iran russia and other state and nonstate actors and profits from a range of illicit activity including opium these activities will allow the taliban—who remain optimistic about their prospects for winning the war—to continue fighting for the foreseeable future130 it is possible that the taliban could moderate some of their positions in the future—such as backing off their insistence on an “islamic emirate” or supporting a system of government that includes democratic characteristics—as part of peace talks but they have not meaningfully done so yet with regard to these issues the possibility of failed negotiations raises serious questions for the united states and other international partners should the united states still withdraw military forces without a veritable peace deal between the afghan government and the taliban or should the united states and other countries keep some forces in afghanistan along with some intelligence personnel diplomats and development experts the united states still has interests in afghanistan though they are not what they were following the september 11th terrorist attacks the united states needs to focus on global competition with countries like china russia and iran as well as the financial implications of covid19 still us interests in afghanistan include preventing the country from becoming a launching pad for international terrorism precluding us adversaries such as china russia and iran from using afghan soil to undermine us national security and minimizing the likelihood of a humanitarian crisis several international terrorist groups continue to operate in afghanistan today including alqaida the islamic state and other organizations that have conducted attacks in the region like lashkaretaiba if an agreement is not reached there are strong arguments for the united states to maintain soldiers in afghanistan to conduct counterterrorism operations and provide limited training equipment and other assistance to afghan forces afghan national security forces are leading the military campaign against the taliban and other insurgent groups and they have done a reasonable job—in part because the taliban have weaknesses the taliban have failed to seize and hold any major cities their extremist ideology is not supported by many afghans their involvement in the drug trade indicates that the group is deeply corrupt and they do not have a strong track record of competent national governance but without a peace deal the further withdrawal of us forces—as highlighted in the november 17 2020 announcement to cut us forces from 4500 to 2500 troops—will likely shift the balance of power in favor of the taliban with continuing support from pakistan russia iran and terrorist groups like alqaida it is the view of the author that the taliban would eventually overthrow the afghan government in kabul in a september 2020 interview former trump national security advisor hr mcmaster remarked that it was wishful thinking to expect the taliban to renounce ties to alqaida and that negotiations are unlikely to be fruitful131 he also asked what powersharing might look like with the taliban “does it look like bulldozing every other girl’s school does it look like mass executions in the soccer stadium every other saturday”132 based on the taliban’s current objectives ideological underpinnings organizational structure military strategies and tactics and relationship with state and nonstate actors it is unlikely that a taliban military or political victory would be in the united states’s interests without significant taliban concessions it is too early to tell whether the taliban will be willing to compromise if not however the war may be far from over     ctc seth g jones is the harold brown chair and director of transnational threats at the center for strategic and international studies csis as well as the author of in the graveyard of empires america’s war in afghanistan follow sethgjones © 2020 seth g jones substantive notes a antonio giustozzi terms the taliban’s organizational structure “polycentric” which indicates more than one center while it is certainly true that there have been power struggles within the taliban movement—including between the rahbari shura and several of the regional shuras—the taliban’s organizational structure is still relatively centralized compared to other insurgent groups on the taliban as a polycentric organization see antonio giustozzi the taliban at war 20012018 new york oxford university press 2019 pp 45 on the taliban’s centralized structure see for example theo farrell and michael semple ready for peace the afghan taliban after a decade of war london royal united services institute january 2017 b ushr is an islamic tax levied on land zakat is an obligatory tax that muslims are expected to donate to the poor and it is one of the five pillars of islam c afghanistan is divided into 34 provinces and each province is further subdivided into administrative units called “districts” d there has been some debate about the taliban’s apparent failure to formally accept alzawahiri’s oath of loyalty to its current leader nevertheless akhundzada has not disavowed alzawahiri’s pledge e the claimed number of attacks is highly implausible based on the author’s review of attack data from us afghan nato un and other sources citations 1 see for example “remarks by

59,20201126  ghana’s 7 december general election will be the country’s eighth consecutive poll since returning to democracy nearly 30 years ago citizens will elect a president and 275 members of parliament although 12 candidates are vying for the presidency the contest is mainly between the incumbent nana addo dankwa akufoaddo of the new patriotic party npp and his predecessor john dramani mahama of the main opposition national democratic congress ndc peaceful exchange of power between the npp and the ndc in 2001 2009 and 2017 has earned the country a reputation of political stability in a rather turbulent west africa yet the npp and ndc have clashed over the neutrality of the electoral commission owing to differences in compiling the new voters register ahead of the elections meetings between the electoral commission and political groups making up the interparty advisory committee indicate some satisfaction with the state of election preparedness but tensions between the two main parties haven’t subsided and set the stage for a potentially disputed outcome tensions between the two main parties may set the stage for a disputed election outcome mahama has accused the electoral commission of setting out to organise a flawed election and threatened to reject the results another sign of trouble was the admission by special development initiatives minister and npp member of parliament mavis hawa koomson to firing a warning shot during an altercation with ndc opponents this was at a voter registration centre on 21 july despite supervising elections in which incumbent parties have lost on three occasions important deficiencies expose the electoral commission to suspicion of political manipulation beyond its head office in accra electoral infrastructure across the country is weak making the commission reliant on the government to mobilise logistics for polls election commissioners have security of tenure and recruitment of permanent and temporary staff is not subject to government control however at the leadership level a chairperson can be removed from office and a new one appointed by the president this arrangement accounts for much of the preelection tension in june 2018 akufoaddo dismissed then chairperson charlotte osei and her two deputies on the recommendation of a committee established by the chief justice of the supreme court the committee had investigated allegations of procurement violations financial malfeasance and incompetence as osei was appointed in 2015 by then president mahama the ndc criticised the move as part of the npp’s plan to manipulate the electoral commission and rig the december 2020 elections despite a solid track record deficiencies expose the electoral commission to accusations of manipulation tensions deepened when jean mensa whom the ndc accused of being pronpp was appointed as new chairperson along with two deputies and a commissioner relations deteriorated when the new leadership announced plans in december 2018 to compile another voter register because the previous one was bloated and contained the names of minors and foreigners the npp had lobbied ghana’s partners on the need for a new register following its narrow loss of the 2012 elections before the 2016 elections two individuals accused of fronting for the npp had filed a supreme court petition against the then oseiled electoral commission essentially affirming the party’s position the commission complied with the court’s ruling that it had cleaned up the register accusations of manipulation deepened when key npp figures agreed publicly with the electoral commission that the old voter id card and birth certificate be excluded from the documents accepted for new registrations in early june the commission secured approval from the nppmajority parliament to accept only passports and national id cards ghana cards as proof of citizenship people with neither document could only register with guarantors who had already registered – a situation the ndc warned would make the process cumbersome before then the ndc accused the national identification authority the agency responsible for issuing national identification the electoral commission and npp of plotting to disenfranchise people who had neither a passport nor a ghana card   the ndc accused the npp of trying to disenfranchise its supporters based on ethnicity and citizenship this is the backdrop for violent clashes between npp and ndc supporters during the 31day voter registration process the attacks occurred in various constituencies and lead to several fatalities the ndc accused the npp of trying to disenfranchise its supporters based on their ethnicity and doubts about their citizenship in the eastern volta region an ndc stronghold the government’s deployment of security forces to border towns as part of its covid19 prevention measures drew accusations of voter intimidation and ethnic discrimination the npp in turn accused the ndc of attempting to register foreigners in the bono region bordering côte d’ivoire an ensuing voter verification process also generated controversy and further polarised positions mahama’s ndc lamented that the revised voters lists in its strongholds were incomplete this raised questions about whether ghana would have a fair credible and transparent voters register before the december elections recurrent suspicions over the electoral commission’s independence don’t augur well for ghana’s political stability in the long run legal and structural deficiencies that underpin these allegations must be addressed to build confidence in the electoral process and reduce the possibility of results being disputed sam kwarkye senior researcher iss regional office for west africa

339,toggle display of website navigation argument china wants to be lebanon’s savior china wants to be lebanon’s savior share argument china wants to be lebanon’s savior one of the middle east’s most westernized outposts is falling apart—and looking east for a soft landing  july 9 2020 921 am chinese ambassador to lebanon wang kejian r presents a gift to lebanese culture minister abbas mortada during a ceremony at the lebanese culture ministry in beirut lebanon on may 27 xinhua via getty images beirut’s little china restaurant is the city’s most prominent establishment that serves authentic chinese food and it’s a regular gathering place for people of chinese origin it also serves as a symbol of china’s marginal role in lebanese life more generally if hassan nasrallah the chief of hezbollah has his way that may soon change nasrallah recently declared in a televised speech that lebanon must “look east” to china for its salvation at its present time of crisis the implication was clear lebanon should not look to the international monetary fund his lebanese audience was left befuddled the extent of crisis was evident—the country’s economy has nosedived to calamitous effect in recent weeks—but lebanon including some of its most reactionary conservatives has always understood itself as an outpost of western values and influence in the middle east but nasrallah is not alone among lebanese policymakers in believing the country may soon have no choice but to enter china’s political and economic orbit if that happens political analysts say it could mark a new and uncertain chapter in the country’s history lebanon’s economy is in shambles threatening to join zimbabwe or venezuela as one of the world’s terminal economic disasters since october 2019 the lebanese pound has lost 80 percent of its value and plummeted from its fixed exchange rate of 1500 to the us dollar to 8000 last week on the black market salaries earned in the local currency have turned worthless as prices of basic commodities have tripled rises in food prices including for bread have hit the middle and lower classes especially hard and electricity cuts have become regular occurrences some lebanese have started resorting to barter while the young and unemployed are increasingly opting for desperate measures to make a living a 24yearold graduate recently walked from shop to shop in a downtown beirut market popular with expatriates to sell freshly squeezed orange juice “hi will you support me please” he asked everyone plaintively but lebanon’s ruling elite continue to drag their feet on political and economic reforms meant to halt corruption and restructure indebted banks measures necessary to procure a 10 billion bailout from the imf two european diplomats told foreign policy that division between lebanese political factions is the reason the imf loan hasn’t yet come through last week alain bifani one of lebanon’s top negotiators with the imf resigned from his senior position at the finance ministry and was quoted as saying he had reached a “dead end” with the political and financial elite he said those with vested interests were obstructing the path to change because any bailout envisioned a haircut of 3 billion on accounts held by the country’s most wealthy millions of lebanese have been braving a de facto haircut since banks imposed capital controls in midnovember 2019 and refused to let them withdraw their money a few days after bifani’s resignation talks with the imf were suspended entirely among the few countries able to productively mediate between the imf and lebanon would be the united states a traditional ally of beirut and the fund’s largest contributor but even as lebanon’s economic crisis accelerates the united states and lebanon’s political actors have intensified their war of words hezbollah has blamed the united states for deliberately stopping the flow of dollars to lebanon while the american representatives accused hezbollah of hoarding dollars and largescale smuggling last week a lebanese judge reprimanded us ambassador to lebanon dorothy shea after she criticized hezbollah he said she was “pitting the lebanese people against each other” and in an unprecedented move he banned media organizations from interviewing her for a year he added that any violation would be punished with a 200000 fine in a show of defiance several local tv channels had the ambassador on air the same evening the united states by unilaterally imposing caesar act sanctions on the syrian regime has also prevented the lebanese economy from benefiting from any reconstruction of its neighboring country meanwhile china although it has little historic political presence in the region is waiting in the wings prepared to replace the united states as the country’s dominant outside actor chinese companies have been trying to launch big projects in lebanon for almost a decade and have been especially eager to invest in lebanon’s infrastructure forty percent of lebanese imports are already chinese and in the last few years beijing has enhanced cultural ties by building a new beirut music center it sent military aid during lebanon’s 2006 war against israel and deployed peacekeepers afterward during the coronavirus pandemic it exercised soft diplomacy and supplied medical assistance including testing kits at the height of lebanon’s coronavirus outbreak the country’s top doctors arranged for online conference calls with their chinese counterparts for information on how best to deal with the health crisis few originally thought china’s overtures would alter the basic calculations of lebanon’s policymakers given the lebanese banking system’s dependence on the us dollar and remittances from lebanese expatriates in the west but lebanon is now desperate enough to explore whatever help beijing can give soon after hezbollah suggested turning to investments from china instead of a bailout from the imf as the panacea to lebanon’s economic crisis lebanon’s prime minister met with the chinese ambassador to seek china’s help and expand economic cooperation china’s interest in the middle east is anchored in the belt and road initiative that aims to expand chinese influence around the world through economic ties china wants to resurrect longdecayed road and rail links between beirut and tripoli on lebanon’s mediterranean coast to the syrian cities of damascus and homs and beyond as part of a broader infrastructure network it controls across eurasia reducing us influence in lebanon would be a bonus some lebanese are intrigued by the prospects of partnering with a dynamic china but many political observers including some in government are more circumspect wary of potential exploitation a member of parliament speaking to foreign policy on condition of anonymity said he was doubtful if “americanized” lebanese would embrace china if that required loosening ties with the united states “we need to assess the readiness of the lebanese first” he said “and if the chinese conditions are going to be acceptable” camille abu suleiman lebanon’s former labor minister said that even though he welcomed chinese investments in principle the reports of their track record had reached lebanon beijing is infamous for laying socalled debt traps—offering quick loans to build infrastructure in underdeveloped countries but at an unusually highinterest rate when the country is unable to pay the debt china simply seizes the assets “i don’t ever see lebanon getting back on its feet without an imf program” suleiman said sami nader a lebanese political analyst shared a similar view “chinese investments will yield results in five to six years by then lebanon will be dead” he said “we need liquidity now we need an imf loan and how does china expect us to pay it back” shen dingli a leading chinese foreignpolicy expert said beijing did not need every country it helped to pay the loan back and can afford to be a soft power to expand its clout globally “when we were poor the us helped us we remember that now we are in a position to help others” he said implying china was readying to be the next united states “we can gift a few hundred million dollars to countries who for instance promise to support us on taiwan internationally” for those protesting on lebanon’s streets the priority isn’t just immediate survival but institutional reforms against corruption that ensure the country does not quickly end up in the same situation again for them that’s why help from china—which has long been known to turn a blind eye to malfeasance by the foreign politicians it loans money to—seems the least attractive option on offer but the lebanese are also acutely aware that they are running out of time anchal vohra is a beirutbased columnist for foreign policy and a freelance correspondent for voice of america and al jazeera english she is also a tv commentator on

340,published nov 16 2020 454am et photo illustration by the daily beastgetty as the 2020 election hit its homestretch joe biden’s digital team began seeing alarming trends online posts about the candidate’s son hunter biden and the contents of his laptops were spreading at incredible rates many of the posts were misleading at best biden’s campaign had set up a comprehensive monitoring system to track the proliferation of disinformation across various platforms and they’d seen their fair share of rumor innuendo and smear fly across the internet before but this was entirely different in its scope according to their data there was more social chatter happening around the hunter biden story than there had been around stories about hillary clinton’s emails during the last month of the 2016 campaign fearing a redux of that disastrous endofthecampaign implosion the team dove further into the research what they found there was more assuring while the hunter biden story had taken off on facebook youtube and various rightwing sites it had not crossed over into mainstream outlets  the campaign’s internal polling meanwhile showed that voters largely weren’t persuaded by it the wildfire ended up being mostly smoke but even so it provided the biden campaign with yet another reminder about the perils that social media platforms present to democrats as they traverse the modern political landscape as the party takes stock of an election in which it suffered unexpected losses downballot and a major triumph at the top of the ticket at least one area of agreement has emerged democrats are still losing the war online part of the deficit is strictly a matter of cash last week rep alexandria ocasiocortez dny publicly chastised her fellow democrats for not making more robust investments in digital advertising but much of it those in the field say is in building the type of news and organic content ecosystem that can match the scale that currently exists on the right “the issue is that when you look at campaign engagement most of the ad spending is not about persuasion it is about donor and supporter acquisition” said ari rabinhavt sen bernie sanders’ ivt top campaign aide and a longtime operative at the intersection of traditional and digital politics “that’s only one part of what campaigns need to do to succeed” at the democratic national committee headquarters and within the biden campaign the power of conservative pundits and media entities online was no secret the major social media platforms prioritized engagement over all else which meant that outrage and conspiracies—both currencies of the trumpier parts of the republican party—were often the most trafficked content at facebook moreover it was widely believed that company leadership went out of its way not to anger conservatives for fear of being accused of bias it would turn out in fact that facebook actively throttled traffic to leftwing sites aides tasked with monitoring this universe compared it to a “centipede” where disinformation started as a kernel in one spot and maneuvered its way through a chain of larger and larger pages and platforms salem media western journal judicial watch the bongino report infowars ben shapiro and daily wire would all pass along similar stories videos and recordings providing a type of information feedback loop that was boosted by facebook’s algorithm and—more importantly—drew in audiences who never felt like they needed to go elsewhere for news “fox news” said one biden campaign staffer “became the left pole of the media ecosystem for a lot of people on the right there is a broad swath of the american right for which fox news is now the center and the info they rely on is from their friends online and on facebook” on occasion that loop would spill out over into more mainstream outlets forcing the biden campaign to react one trouble spot it found early on were memes and videos made to portray biden as senile but research showed that the campaign was able to beat back against those impressions by simply pushing out videos of biden in a natural setting another more humorous incident came before the first debate when a swath of the online right began theorizing that biden would sneak in an earpiece “we assumed people were not persuaded by it” the biden aide recalled “but it became such a part of the conversation that we felt we needed to respond” the result was a biden tweet mocking the chatter what had seemed like a spurofthemoment attempt at poking fun at the conspiracists was in reality a calculated decision to take steam out of viral content from the right for president donald trump the feedback loop was an important tool at his disposal daily rankings of the top performing facebook posts always featured trumpsupportive sites while youtube became a breeding ground for conspiracy theorists an entire insular world was metastasizing that wasn’t being picked up in the polls or influenced by the media even the qanon conspiracy had its tactical benefits biden campaign tracking data showed the community—which holds that major us institutions are actually being run by a cabal of satanworshiping pedophiles—growing beyond “the fringe” as the country was locked down during the covid19 quarantine in the spring soon enough its adherents began spreading wild lies about biden such as him owning a private island near jeffrey epstein’s in addition to their usual threads on hollywood celebrities and the clintons on top of that moments that should have been politically damaging for the president were turned into powerful tools to buck up his supporters and reinforce his key messaging “impeachment was so bad for us because it fit into trump’s metanarrative that they reinforced every day” said tara mcgowan a leading democratic digital strategist referring to the persistent “deep state” conspiracy theories and allegations of biden family corruption that pervaded conservative media amid the historic rebuke of the president “i don’t know that we would’ve been able to recover from the lawandorder narrative if the president himself hadn’t contracted the virus” months later as racial unrest erupted—occasionally violently—in cities around the country democrats faced the same feedback loop of conservative posts and commentary that reinforced some of the president’s central political messaging the riots in kenosha wisconsin following the shooting of a black man by police there created such a scare for the biden digital team that it was one of the few times they advised the communications shop to forcefully push back against the emerging narrative in this case of biden being on the side of the protesters “i don’t know that we would’ve been able to recover from the lawandorder narrative if the president himself hadn’t contracted the virus” said mcgowan describing the president’s coronavirus diagnosis as a seminal moment that shifted the online conversation back to his poor handling of the pandemic “frankly if the pandemic had not come” she said “i think we would’ve absolutely lost this presidential election” mcgowan has more insights into the precariousness of the democratic party’s position in the online wars than most when democrats emerged from the wreckage of the 2016 election she and others vowed that they would dramatically scale up their digital footprint to match what trump had brought to bear and to a degree they did biden’s campaign managed to keep pace with trump’s behemoth online advertising operation this year in particular its focus on facebook ads a lynchpin of team trump’s heralded online infrastructure but mcgowan and other democrats steeped in the world of digital politicking say the party ended up spending all its time fighting the last war rather than anticipating the next one determined to put up raw numbers that rivaled past republican dominance on platforms like facebook and youtube they failed to grasp what makes for a truly effective digital strategy it’s not about flooding the zone with paid content these democrats say it’s about building lasting infrastructure that speaks the language of the tens of millions of voters—and growing—who grew up on these platforms and navigate the digital world in ways that can’t be mapped or exploited by decades old political advertising strategies one democratic strategist who spoke with the daily beast pointed to two recent efforts pulso and pushblack  as examples to emulate—social mediacentric subscription news services that cater to discrete constituencies and which toward the end of the cycle shifted their attention to voter registration and getoutthevote efforts “they’re still applying a traditional polltested message deployed in a broadcast manner across channels to traditionally modeled universes of voters” mcgowan said of party leaders “even though they’re spending more to reach these voters online they’re not rethinking who these people are what messages really resonate with them” “it’s not enough to just pour more money into oneway ads if we’re not actually building audiences or infrastructure” “it’s not enough to just pour more money into oneway ads if we’re not actually building audiences or infrastructure” she added but the party is divided about how much to prioritize the digital space there are factions which include mcgowan that have invested in creating a constellation of online advertisers and content hubs including a controversial network of localized quasinews outlets there are others however who think the onus right now has to be on counteracting and limiting the reach of the false and misleading information spreading on social media networks “we don’t care about having the one viral video that everyone saw but didn’t actually achieve our goals” said becca rinkevich director of political programs at the digital firm bully pulpit “we care about showing a united force and having these other credible voices weigh in it’s a lot more work to do that sort of disciplined message” biden ultimately was able to maneuver through the social media minefield but other democrats were not as fortunate in a memo detailing his explanations for why the party failed to perform better in texas—after so much hype that they would—former 2020 presidential candidate and former rep beto o’rourke placed one issue above all others among republicans’ “asymmetrical advantages” that democrats need to counter o’rourke wrote is “the ability to campaign free of the truth” a tactic that he attributed largely to “social media and texting campaigns” undertaken by the president’s campaign and supporters “we have to be more effective on digital and social media” o’rourke wrote “the anecdotal takeaway from those i’ve listened to especially in border communities is that trumpgop had a ferocious game” online he said “and we had none” not everyone in the party buys the logic there is a thread of thinking among some democrats that the insular universe that conservatives have built online is both impenetrable and not worth duplicating “the way that they’ve constructed what gets play on their platform is just a petri dish of misinformation and extremism” said maddie kriger who serves as integrated media director at priorities usa about facebook’s algorithm “my personal view is that there is no way for someone who is not basically telling lies to game the system” but others who work in digital politics argue that the party can’t simply assume that its voters will always be reachable through traditional means and that it is a massively important investment to create online content that can bring in new audiences the question isn’t whether to do it they say it’s how david goldstein the ceo of the digital media organization tovo labs and a former obama pollster estimated that he was on “at least one to two hundred different conference calls” with democrats this cycle and heard only one person mention talking to trump voters on facebook “if you were to say to the democrats ‘ok there’s this evangelical group that are 80 percent against you’ the immediate democratic response is ‘whoa we’ll never catch them’” he said “tell a republican group that ‘hey this group of urban black women are 94 percent against you’ and they immediately think ‘oh this 6 percent is for us’” while there are entities on the left that specialize in online content creation—such as the other 98 and occupy democrats—their reach is limited compared not just to those on the right but to the sandersminded outlets whose content is most antiestablishment in nature operatives say this is in part due to a fundamental difference in how the parties currently operate while the trump era has birthed a type of politicalmediacelebrity hybrid who can draw major audiences online think dan bongino democrats fell behind someone in biden whose candidacy was built around the notion that understatement was good “the right is able to cultivate these personalities on fox news sit down and watch hannity over the week it’s the same 10 people over and over” said one democratic communications strategist “they build up a celebrity on the right in a way that we just don’t do on the left those celebrities then take their content to facebook and then they all interact with each other and push their content out” but a good chunk of it is structural too democratic digital operatives say the party has simply transposed its traditional broadcast advertising strategy onto digital media platforms rather than attempting to build up a permanent online infrastructure native to digital platforms themselves more than one digital strategist noted with varying degrees of scorn that the center for american progress—the party’s preeminent think tank—decided to shut down its online publication think progress rather than turn it into a content creation farm for facebook and youtube “the party needs to dedicate far more resources toward longterm and online organizing as opposed to paid advertising or specific candidate support” one democratic digital strategist told the daily beast this cycle support for that sort of program was difficult to come by mcgowan says she was forced to turn to investors in silicon valley who grasped the nuances of her vision for online politicking far better than traditional hubs of democratic financial support to fund her network of political and advocacy groups those running the commanding heights of democratic politics she said are simply too entrenched—and financially invested in—traditional modes of politicking to hope for much support in the upper echelons of the party’s political apparatus “whether you’re talking about the donors or the leaders of the party or the largest super pacs they all have been working together for many many years and this is the playbook they know and people are very averse to embracing and advocating and deploying a playbook that is not native to them” mcgowan said “we need anyone who is not native on the platforms where the majority of americans spend their time to not be in positions of leadership that determine budgets” “the people who stuck around after 2016 because they wanted to go out on a high note we need them to now go out on a high note” she added “and we need people who understand where the information war is being waged in positions of power and authority” with reporting by jackie kucinich,3
93,“welcome to my mom’s house” joe biden called from the bottom of the stairs an instant before his sweep of white hair rose into view  the former vicepresident of the united states and the democratic nominee for president reached the second floor of a cottage at the foot of his property in greenville delaware a wooded welltodo suburb of wilmington he wore a trim blue dress shirt sleeves rolled to the elbows a pen tucked between the buttons and a brightwhite n95 mask it was ninetynine days to the election the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic was approaching a hundred and fifty thousand three times as many lives as america lost in vietnam the economy had crumbled faster than at any other time in the nation’s history in portland oregon federal agents in unmarked uniforms were teargassing protesters whom donald trump called “sick and deranged anarchists  agitators” on twitter that day trump warned that the demonstrators would “destroy our american cities and worse if sleepy joe biden the puppet of the left ever won markets would crash and cities would burn”  the man who stands between americans and four more years of trump lives with his wife jill on four sloping acres that overlook a small lake these days the biden place feels as solemn and secluded as an abbey to avoid contagion biden’s advisers had put me in a carriage house a hundred yards from the house where the family lives the cottage styled in celtic themes green shutters a thistle pattern on the throw pillows doubles as a command post for the secret service and large men with holstered guns stalked in and out biden settled into an armchair across the room from me and splayed his hands a socially distanced salute “the docs keep it really tight” he explained  later that afternoon the bidens were due on capitol hill to pay their respects to the recently deceased john lewis of georgia a civilrights icon who endured a fractured skull at the hands of state troopers in selma alabama before rising to the house of representatives and becoming known as the “conscience of congress” it would be a rare excursion since the covid shutdown began in march biden had circulated mostly between his back porch where he convened fundraisers on zoom a gym upstairs and the basement rec room where he sat for tv interviews in front of a bookcase and a folded flag the campaign apparatus had scattered into the homes of some twentythree hundred employees biden seemed pleased to have company before i could ask a question he explained the origins of the cottage when his father joe sr fell ill in 2002 biden renovated the basement of the main house and moved his parents in “god love him he lasted for about six months” he said “i thought my mom would stay” she had other ideas biden’s mother the former jean finnegan plays a formidable role in his recounting of family history in grammar school he recalls a nun mocked him for stuttering and his mother a devout catholic told her “if you ever speak to my son like that again i’ll come back and rip that bonnet off your head”  after jean became a widow biden said she offered him a proposition “she said ‘joey if you build me a house i’ll move in here’ i said ‘honey i don’t have the money to build you a house’ she said ‘i know you don’t’ she said ‘but i talked to your brothers and sister sell my house and build me an apartment’ ” for years biden who relied on his government salary was among the least prosperous members of the united states senate in the two years after he left the vicepresidency the bidens earned more than fifteen million dollars from speeches teaching and book deals biden renovated an old garage and his mother moved in “i’d walk in and she’d be in that chair downstairs facing the fireplace watching television” he said “there’d always be a caregiver on the stool and she’d be hearing her confession”  joe biden has been a “public man” as he puts it—holding office giving interviews dispensing anecdotes—for five decades i last interviewed him mostly about foreign affairs in 2014 when he was in the white house and donald trump was hosting season 14 of “the apprentice” biden is seventyseven years old and he looks thinner than he did six years ago but not markedly so his verbiage is as meandering as ever james comey the former fbi director once wrote that the typical biden conversation originated in “direction a” before “heading in direction z” in december biden’s campaign released a doctor’s summary of his medical records which pronounced him a “healthy vigorous” man of his age  the implications of age in one form or another hover over the presidential race trump took office as the oldest president in history he is now seventyfour to deflect questions about his mental acuity he and his allies present biden as senile a theme that dominates rightwing tv and twitter biden sees little of it he doesn’t look at social media if there is something big his staff will include a tweet in the morning roundup of news that he reads on his phone but he said “i don’t look at a lot of the comments i spend the time trying to focus on the trouble people are in right now”  by the end of august ten weeks before the election biden led trump by an average of at least eight percentage points but no earthly inhabitant expected an ordinary end to the campaign some polls showed the race tightening and trump and the gop held a persistent advantage in perceptions of their handling of the economy “i feel good about where we are” biden said “but i know that it’s going to get really really ugly” as trump disputed the legitimacy of mailin voting his postmaster general was brazenly cutting service in ways that could prevent ballots from being counted trump’s campaign was trying to deter black voters running commercials claiming that as one put it biden had “destroyed millions of black lives” republican operatives were helping kanye west the protrump hiphop star get on the ballot in multiple states meanwhile us intelligence warned that as in 2016 russians were working to damage trump’s opponent this time with phone recordings edited to support the canard that biden had used the vicepresidency to help his son hunter make money in ukraine  advertisement for a frontrunner biden was hardly sanguine “i am worried about them screwing around with the election outcome” he said “when the hell have you heard a president say ‘i’m not sure i’ll accept the outcome’”  the trials of 2020 have dismantled some of the most basic stories we americans tell ourselves the world’s richest most powerful country has botched even rudimentary responses to the pandemic—finding masks making tests—and some agencies have proved to be so antiquated and starved of resources that they’ve used fax machines to share data the white house offered policies that read like mock kafka even as people were advised against dining out it was proposing a corporate tax break on business meals on fox news in april jared kushner the president’s soninlaw and one of the leaders of the coronavirus response declared the administration’s effort “a great success story” since then at least a hundred and ten thousand more people have died and in the midst of the pandemic the death of george floyd under a policeman’s knee opened a second epochal turn in american history—a reckoning with the entrenched hierarchy of power which isabel wilkerson in her new book “caste” calls “the wordless usher in a darkened theater flashlight cast down in the aisles guiding us to our assigned seats”  an officer strumming a guitar interrogates a suspect another officer holding a banjo stands outside the interrogation “don’t feel like talking fine maybe it’s time you had a little chat with my partner” cartoon by matthew diffee biden believes that trump’s failures of leadership particularly in the pandemic have become clear even to steadfast republican advocates “everybody knows even people supporting him this is all about his selfinterest it’s all about him” he told me “it has had profound impacts on people’s ability to live their life” still it might not suffice to change voters’ minds when biden characterizes trump’s supporters they are not duped or culpable or deplorable “they think that they will be materially better off if he’s president” he said “he has gotten through i think to some degree—to about forty per cent—saying ‘the democrats are socialists they’re here to take away everything you have’ ”  video from the new yorker voter intimidation returns to america  republicans have long accused democrats of plotting to smuggle socialism into the united states but levelling that charge against biden whose career has been distinguished mostly by careful centrism is an awkward task biden entered the democratic primaries with a narrow goal to end the trump presidency most americans he argued did not want a revolution at an early fundraiser in new york he promised not to “demonize” the rich and said that “nothing would fundamentally change” online people circulated mock campaign posters in the colorblock style of obama’s “hope” picture with the slogan “nothing would fundamentally change” but by the time biden effectively clinched the nomination in march he had begun to describe his candidacy as a bid for systemic change on the scale of franklin roosevelt’s new deal according to a senior aide to bernie sanders biden told sanders in a phone call about a possible endorsement “i want to be the most progressive president since fdr”  that evolution has confounded critics on all sides biden was simultaneously accused of being a socialist puppet and a neoliberal shill to his detractors on the left—especially younger highly educated more ideological democrats who are active online—biden was a creature of the ancien régime and a cheerleader of the nationalsecurity state with such timid appetites for change that when he won on super tuesday the price of healthcare stocks went up liberals were dismayed that the most diverse presidential field in history had yielded a white man in his eighth decade it was as if a waiter had returned from the kitchen with news that the specials were gone and all that was left was oatmeal of course they always had the option of more rat poison  maurice mitchell the national director of the working families party told me “people said ‘oh this man’s a hack’ he’s not an ideological person and ideology clearly matters to us he was running a retrograde candidacy during the primary it was all about going back to the track we were on with the obama years” mitchell who is also a leader in the movement for black lives said that biden’s change of tone caught the attention of progressives “he’s recognizing that this might be a rooseveltian moment he’s not all the way there—nobody thinks joe biden is a progressive star—but he can be a product of either your most cynical thinking or a product of your most optimistic thinking”  in a recent interview i asked barack obama how he interprets biden’s swerve to the left “if you look at joe biden’s goals and bernie sanders’s goals they’re not that different from a fortythousandfoot level” he argued “they both want to make sure everybody has health care they want to make sure everybody can get a job that pays a living wage they want to make sure every child gets a good education” the question was one of tactics obama suggested “a lot of times the issue has to do with ‘how do we go about that and what are the coalitions we need’ ” he said “what i think the moment has done is to change some of those calculations not because necessarily joe’s changed but because circumstances have changed”  the tensions afflicting the democratic party reflect a clash between liberal meliorism—the “long view” politics of obama and biden—and the impatient movement that sanders calls a “revolution” the two factions claim competing virtues one emphasizes realism coalitionbuilding and practical politics and the other the inescapable evidence that “reform” has failed to confront pervasive inequalities the cruelties of american health care and incarceration and ecological catastrophe  the division is as much generational as it is ideological young americans have been reared on fiascoes—the invasion of iraq the response to hurricane katrina the 2008 financial crisis—and have come to blame that record partly on gerontocracy the median american is thirtyeight years old the median us senator is sixtyfive the current congress is among the oldest in history senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is seventyeight house speaker nancy pelosi is eighty the difference in age often underlies a profound difference in world view in the words of patrick fisher a seton hall professor who specializes in the political dynamics of age “demographically politically economically socially and technologically the generations are more different from each other now than at any time in living memory”  millennials constitute the largest generation in america today and the most diverse in the nation’s history they entered the job market during the worst recession since the nineteenthirties people under twentyfive have faced unemployment rates more than double those of other age groups by 2012 a record number of adults between eighteen and thirtyone were living with their parents in the twentytens as trumpism was germinating on the right a rival political movement was growing on the left driven by young people many had put their hopes in obama and concluded that if he could not marshal political parties to act then nobody could between 2013 and 2017 the median age of members of the democratic socialists of america dropped from sixtyeight to thirtythree many others expressed a desire for a socialism that was closer to the new deal in 2019 greta thunberg the swedish teenager who inspired a global climate strike told the united nations “change is coming whether you like it or not”  when i asked obama about the tensions in the party he cast them as features of “the traditional democratic idea” he said “you have a bigtent party and that means that you tolerate listen to and embrace folks who are different than you and try to get them in the fold and so you work with not just liberal democrats but you work with conservative democrats—and you are willing to compromise on issues” that was a gentle jab at democrats who see compromise as a failing in comments last year obama bemoaned the emergence of a “circular firing squad” in the party “this idea of purity and you’re never compromised and you’re always politically woke and all that stuff you should get over that quickly” he said  biden has expressed frustration with young people’s tepid participation in elections last year he griped that as trump won in 2016 “they sat home didn’t get involved” yet when we spoke recently he took pains to sound more conciliatory “this generation has really been screwed” he said “these were really the most open the least prejudiced the brightest the besteducated generation in american history and what’s happening they end up with 911 they end up with a war they end up with the great recession and then they end up with this this generation deserves help in the middle of this crisis”  in the spring biden began describing himself as a “transition candidate” explaining “we have not given a bench to younger people in the party the opportunity to have the focus and be in focus for the rest of the country there’s an incredible group of talented newer younger people” ben rhodes an adviser to obama in the white house said “it’s actually a really powerful idea it says ‘i’m a seventysevenyearold white man who was a senator for thirty years and i understand both those limitations and the nature of this country’ because no matter what he does he cannot completely understand the frustration of people in the streets that’s not a criticism it’s just a reality” a senior obama administration official observed that biden’s acknowledgment also contained a subtler message “this country needs to just chill the fuck out and have a boring president”  to varshini prakash a twentysevenyearold cofounder of the sunrise movement an organization that presses for action on climate change biden recognized the urgency of showing more than rhetorical interest in the young left “you have a presidential candidate who essentially staked his career on advocating incremental solutions” she told me “then he finds himself at this moment where people are fed up with much of the status quo he represents—an economic system that has reigned supreme for forty years that he was part of advocating for but also health climate gun violence immigration all of these have reached a fever pitch i think covid19 was the moment that pushed it over the edge where he recognized if he doesn’t have a way to meet his incrementalism with the level of transformative change that people are crying out for he’s going to be in deep trouble”  for the ride to lewis’s memorial biden boarded an armored black suv he had changed from campaignfromhome attire into mourning clothes—a crisp white shirt dark suit and tie and black mask at the capitol rotunda he and jill were met by nancy pelosi whom they hadn’t seen since the lockdowns began they huddled in conversation and then the bidens approached lewis’s flagdraped casket which rested on the spot where abraham lincoln lay in state a century and a half ago like others biden had challenged republicans to honor lewis by restoring the voting rights act—to “protect the sacred right to vote that he was willing to die for” as biden put it the law had served as a check on racial discrimination at the polls from 1965 to 2013 when the supreme court ruled that conditions no longer required it since then republicans in many states have expanded efforts to bar voters through specious requirements in the senate mcconnell has blocked bills seeking to restore the act  in the preceding days lewis’s casket had retraced an arc of the black freedom struggle beginning in his home town of troy alabama crossing the edmund pettus bridge in selma and stopping at the newly christened black lives matter plaza near the white house at the capitol biden laid his hand on the casket and made the sign of the cross  trump for his part had skipped the memorial lewis once declared that he was not a “legitimate president” to which trump responded in an unsubtle slur that lewis’s congressional district was “crime infested” under pressure to say something trump had tweeted on the way back from golf that he was saddened and that “melania and i send our prayers to he and his family”  in the presidential race the upheavals of 2020 have afforded trump abundant opportunities to look racist and inept while sparing biden a famously looselipped campaigner the risks of slogging through a full schedule his aides disputed suggestions that they have been purposely allowing trump to hog the spotlight but in may biden said frankly “the more he talks the better off i am”  reticence has never been biden’s default mode even in washington the windbag mecca he distinguished himself when obama newly elected to the senate heard biden hold forth in a meeting of the foreign relations committee he passed an aide a threeword note “shoot me now” a former longtime staffer recalled that he learned to flex his knees during the boss’s speeches to avoid fainting biden knows his reputation and sometimes jokes about it when his microphone once malfunctioned during a television interview he said “they do this to me at the white house all the time”  biden’s conspicuous appetite for human connection was likely a big factor in his primary victory pete buttigieg one of his opponents observed biden backstage before a debate “some candidates would be talking to each other” he told me “some candidates would be talking almost to themselves” but biden was kibbitzing with the stagehands or trying to buck up the newcomer candidates “i think any human being who’s around is somebody that he’s equally happy to engage and talk to and listen to” buttigieg said  biden vacillates between embracing the image of a kindly grandfather and bridling at it when in 2015 the latenight host stephen colbert referred to him on the air as a “nice old man” biden called him the next day colbert told me “he goes ‘listen buddy you call me a nice old man one more time and i will personally come down there and kick your ass’ i laughed and he laughed i said ‘don’t worry i won’t call you a nice old man because clearly you’re not that nice’ ”  a person at a sleepover tells a scary story about an undelivered package “and no matter how many times they got it redelivered they were never home to receive the package” cartoon by drew panckeri in truth biden’s effusiveness has always disguised a prickly side among staff he is known for giving support to talented people without connections but he can also be curt and demanding leaving the menial work of fundraising to others he sometimes lavishes more gratitude on strangers who want selfies than on aides who have spent years keeping him in office jeff connaughton a disenchanted former aide once called biden an “egomaniacal autocrat” but connaughton who became a lobbyist also admired biden’s contempt for the corrupting gladhanding of washington “biden never lifted a finger for me or for one of my clients” he wrote in his book “the payoff” “unlike most of congress he hardly ever schmoozed with the permanent class he did the best he could to stay as far away from it as possible”  advertisement for all his longevity in washington biden has never quite belonged to the technocratic élite to the dominant democrats—the clinton and obama circles—he was too mawkish with the scranton joe routine too transparent in his ambition biden is the first democratic nominee without an ivy league degree since walter mondale in 1984 in a milieu of rhodes scholars and former professors he is thinskinned about condescension real and imagined when obama chose him as his running mate he said “i want your point of view joe i just want it in tenminute increments not sixtyminute increments” biden chafed telling david axelrod obama’s chief strategist “i still think i’d be the best president” but after a year of observing obama biden told axelrod that he had been mistaken “the right guy won and i’m just really proud to be associated with him”  biden’s insecurities fed a certain openness and vulnerability even after decades in national office he talked to anyone in reach partly because he was trawling for what others knew and he did not the senior obama administration official who periodically briefed biden recalled “he would talk for ninety per cent of the conversation and yet he always picked something up at the end we’d get up and walk out and he’d clap me on the back ‘great talk’ and i’d be a bit dazed” the official added “so the question is which joe biden governs the one that is sincerely open and searching for the perspectives that will help him be more effective or the joe biden that will talk at you because he thinks he has enough words and expertise to muscle through any situation”  in the usual telling joseph robinette biden jr is a product of the silent generation the cohort of cautious americans born between the great depression and the end of the second world war who were too young to have fought overseas and too old to lead the counterculture to be born in america in 1942 as a white heterosexual male was generally speaking to win a cosmic lottery because of low birth rates during the depression and the war the generation was exceptionally small—the first in american history to be smaller than the one before it its members enjoyed more attention and resources from their parents smaller class sizes and high rates of college admission the new deal and the gi bill gave them benefits loans and federal work programs which thrust millions of white americans into the middle class the sociologist elwood carlson assessing their fortunes in his book “the lucky few” described an age when american companies expanded workforces built pensions and distributed stock—a combination that produced “the financially luckiest generation of the twentieth century”  their advantages shaped their ideas about government money race and opportunity they were a homogeneous lot nearly nine out of ten were white and born in the united states they tended as carlson put it to “view their successes in life as their own achievements rather than thinking in terms of the social context that made their success possible” in politics their right wing included “the most conservative republicans of any generation in the twentieth century”  biden fit the mold in some respects and defied it in others the eldest of four siblings he was ten when his father out of a job moved the family to delaware where he cleaned boilers and sold used cars joe was a middling but popular student at archmere academy a private day school to defray his tuition he worked on a grounds crew while at the university of delaware he played football and worked one summer as a lifeguard at a public pool where he came to know young black men who lived in a nearby housing project brett gadsden a historian at northwestern university who grew up near wilmington and has written about its racial politics describes the city as suspended between north and south—closer to new york city than to raleigh but still so segregated that african diplomats driving through on the way to washington were sometimes denied service at rest stops “there’s probably a metaphorical lesson in the fact that biden hails from a place that has this mythical reputation as a middleground state” gadsden told me “it’s emblematic of a kind of imagined center”  biden played bit parts in protests against segregation including walking out of a wilmington diner that refused to serve a black classmate in 1961 and picketing the segregated rialto movie theatre the following year later he sometimes exaggerated his role “i marched” but in 2013 during a ceremony commemorating the march in selma biden expressed remorse that he had not done more “i was involved in my state in a small way which was still fighting the lingering vestiges of jim crow” biden told the audience “but i regret and although it’s not part of what i’m supposed to say apologize it took me fortyeight years to get here i should’ve been here”  he attended barely syracuse university’s law school where he had to repeat a course because he failed to properly footnote a paper in his first year he claimed to have skipped so many classes that he didn’t know the rules he met neilia hunter an english major and in the solemn prose of his memoir “promises to keep” “i fell ass over tin cup in love” they married biden became a public defender and in 1972 after a short stint on a county council he made an audacious run for the us senate he was an underdog polling thirty points behind j caleb boggs a lowenergy incumbent biden twentynine years old played up his youth campaigning with his photogenic family and publishing ads with the tagline “he understands what’s happening today” the wilmington evening journal observed that voters his age “get that ‘new hero’ look when biden raps about how the old guard has bungled things” he won by just three thousand votes  on the afternoon of december 18th a few weeks after the election biden’s life came apart neilia was behind the wheel of the family’s white chevy station wagon returning with their three kids from buying a christmas tree a tractortrailer loaded with corncobs hit them broadside leaving the road littered with campaign brochures neilia and naomi the baby were killed hunter age two suffered a head injury beau who was three was hospitalized for weeks with broken bones  biden who had lived a life of almost preposterous good fortune thought of suicide in “what it takes” the classic study of the minds of politicians richard ben cramer wrote of biden’s grief about the accident “all of it all of them—all they’d done—did not matter gone” the press wanted a simple tale of a brave widower cramer wrote but “joe was so sick of it he could puke”  biden considered resigning his senate seat but was talked out of it by a party elder mike mansfield as a single father he took to riding the train back to delaware each night from washington ted kaufman one of biden’s closest aides told me “six months after the accident he would come into the office and he would be in as bad a shape as he was the day of the accident he had one of neilia’s rings and he’d put it on his little finger if he came into the office with that ring on his finger—oh boy you knew he was really hurting”  over the years biden learned tactics for coping he kept a pen and pad beside his bed and rated each day from one to ten to track his progress he adopted his father’s belief that fate eventually apportions each person or each family a balanced ledger of fortune “the bigger the highs” he liked to say “the deeper the troughs”  when biden arrived in the senate in 1973 he focussed mainly on staying there a freshman profile in washingtonian magazine noted “senator biden doesn’t believe issues make much difference in an election—personality and presentation are the key” in office he was careful to avoid becoming known as a liberal  national partisan polarization was at a historic low and voters often divided their loyalties among candidates from multiple parties in 1974 on the basis of his support of civil rights and opposition to the war in vietnam biden received a high rating from americans for democratic action a progressive nonprofit group he complained about it “those ada ratings get us into so much trouble that a lot of us sit around thinking up ways to vote conservative” he told a reporter “when it comes to civil rights and civil liberties i’m a liberal but that’s it i’m really quite conservative on most other issues my wife said i was the most socially conservative man she had ever known”  at a community meeting that summer white suburbanites heckled biden for his willingness to support courtordered busing he became their champion—the democratic party’s leading antibusing crusader gadsden of northwestern was among the students in the wilmington area who were bused to a mostly black school over biden’s opposition “personally i think my classmates and i benefitted greatly from the opportunity” he told me “it is understandable in a strict political sense that biden opposed busing in the early nineteenseventies as a matter of history however biden purposefully chose to ignore a long record of violations against the constitutional rights of black children” that put him “squarely within the liberal retreat from civil rights that dates back to the busing backlash and runs through president clinton’s politics of triangulation” he said  as biden rose in the senate he was rebuilding his family on a blind date in 1975 he met jill jacobs an aspiring teacher from the philadelphia suburbs jacobs puzzled over the man who was as she put it “nothing like the sideburned bellbottomwearing guys i was used to dating” they married in 1977 in their white house years jill biden taught english at northern virginia community college becoming the firstknown sitting second lady to hold a paying job  biden’s ambitions and insecurities periodically bedevilled him running for president in 1987 he took to quoting the british labour leader neil kinnock then stopped mentioning kinnock and kept using the words reporters linked that plagiarism—an unconscious mistake he said—with his rejected paper in law school and at an event a voter pressed him about his record biden seethed “i probably have a much higher iq than you do” he said bragging that he’d received “a full academic scholarship” and “ended up in the top half of my class” neither of which was true his race was over for years he blamed the loss on opposition research and an overzealous press but in 2007 when he was running for president again he put the excuses aside “the bottom line was i made a mistake and it was born out of my arrogance” he told a reporter “i didn’t deserve to be president”  in the senate biden accrued a record that to today’s progressives resembles the counts in an indictment overseeing the confirmation hearings of the supreme court nominee clarence thomas he failed to insure that anita hill’s accusations of sexual harassment were fairly and fully examined he voted for the deregulation of wall street the defense of marriage act the north american free trade agreement the war in iraq during the primaries elizabeth warren faulted him for having legislated “on the side of the creditcard companies” jacobin the socialist magazine described him in a headline as “the forrest gump of the democratic party’s rightward turn”  advertisement nothing in biden’s record has dogged him more than his role in drafting the 1994 crime bill the most sweeping legislation of its kind in american history the bill contributed to the problems of mass incarceration by creating a federal “three strikes” law encouraging longer jail terms and granting billions of dollars to states to build more prisons  a third explorer with lewis and clark is carried away by a hawk “make sure people remember lewis and clark and scherling” cartoon by benjamin schwartz at the time the bill had support from some democrats on the left including bernie sanders and from black political leaders including representative james e clyburn of south carolina clyburn had learned through difficult experience that many of his black constituents were less enthusiastic than white liberals about criminaljustice reform at a townhall meeting in 1994 he had voiced skepticism about an initiative for stricter sentences “i got my head handed to me in that meeting and everybody in that meeting was black” clyburn told me recently “crack cocaine was a scourge in the black communities they wanted it out of those communities and they had gotten very tough on drugs and that’s why yours truly and other members of the congressional black caucus voted for that 1994 crime bill” clyburn like biden remains proud that the bill included the violence against women act a ban on assault weapons and money for community policing and drug courts in the fall of 1994 republicans took control of the house and clyburn faults them for changes they instituted “they kept all the punitive stuff and got rid of the good stuff” he said biden has offered similarly qualified regrets “i know we haven’t always gotten things right but i’ve always tried” he said last year “we thought we were told by the experts that crack you never go back—that it was somehow fundamentally different it’s not different but it has trapped an entire generation”  in “locking up our own” a pulitzer prizewinning study of criminal justice and racial politics james forman jr describes mass incarceration as the consequence of “a series of small decisions made over time by a disparate group of actors” at bottom they could be traced to what forman calls the “politics of responsibility” a theory of personal discipline consonant with the individualism of the silent generation and the boomers that was voiced regularly at the top of the democratic party in bill clinton’s inaugural address in 1993 he vowed to “offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all” in addition to the crime bill the politics of responsibility inspired welfare reform in 1996 which limited federal benefits for the poor and bankruptcy legislation in 2005 supported by biden which made it harder for americans to resolve their debts  when i asked cornell william brooks a harvard professor an activist and a former head of the naacp to assess biden’s record in washington he offered an image reminiscent of biden’s mental ledger of highs and lows “people love the fact that he faithfully and well served the nation’s first africanamerican president—and hate his leadership on the crime bill they are troubled by his positions on busing but they measure him as a historical whole and by the stature of his sincerity” brooks said “the things which are most disquieting about joe biden to the progressive wing of the democratic base are the very things that are most disquieting about the democratic party”  the obama presidency was supposed to mark a new chapter in the generational story of american politics the triumph of what stacey abrams the votingrights activist and former georgia gubernatorial candidate calls the “new american majority”—a coalition of “people of color young people and moderate to progressive whites” in 2008 obama won an astonishing twothirds of millennials  when obama asked biden to join the ticket some democrats were baffled biden running as a candidate in that year’s primaries had failed to crack one per cent in the iowa caucuses but obama admired his feisty debate performance his knowledge of foreign leaders and his connections in dc biden was also as axelrod put it to me “culturally and geographically well situated” he made obama more attractive to older workingclass midwestern whites who might not feel a natural connection to a black former community organizer beneath the raw electoral calculation biden and obama shared a basic belief that americans craved unity in politics running for president obama called attention to fraying social bonds he told an audience in 2008 “i’m talking about an empathy deficit the inability to recognize ourselves in one another to understand that we are our brother’s keeper and our sister’s keeper—and in the words of dr king we are all tied together in a ‘single garment of destiny’ ”  biden’s vision was less transcendent “look” he told me “i never expect a foreign leader i’m dealing with or a colleague senator a congressperson to voluntarily appear in the second edition of ‘profiles in courage’ so you got to think of what is in their interest” and yet biden’s accounting of political interests sometimes nudged him closer to progressives in may 2012 while obama was weighing an endorsement of samesex marriage biden beat him to it telling an interviewer that he was “absolutely comfortable” with the idea obama’s aides were incensed a former biden staffer recalled “we were told that his public activities were going to be curtailed for the week” many outsiders saw the moment as a typical biden gaffe but white house officials recognized a pattern in biden’s calculations “he is very much a weathervane for what the center of the left is” the senior obama administration official told me “he can see ‘ok this is where the society is moving this is where the democratic party is moving so i’m going to move’ ”  as the country recovered from the financial crisis biden distributed stimulus funds and managed a vast array of local and state interests later he used his sway with congress to help pass the affordable care act at times though democrats grew irritated by biden’s belief that he could manage republican leaders toward compromise in the last days of 2012 bushera tax cuts were set to expire which would have raised 37 trillion in revenue over the next decade to try to keep the tax cuts republicans threatened to default on the us debt for the first time in history biden negotiated a lastminute compromise with mcconnell they agreed to recoup six hundred billion dollars of that revenue while allowing some tax cuts to become permanent harry reid the senate majority leader was said to be so appalled by the terms that he threw the paperwork in a fireplace reid denies this  a few months later biden’s personal life changed in a way that shadowed his remaining years in the white house in the summer of 2013 his son beau who was the attorney general of delaware and a father of two was diagnosed as having glioblastoma an aggressive form of brain cancer father and son were unusually close biden sometimes told friends that beau had “all of my best qualities and none of my worst” beau entered a gruelling regimen of surgery and experimental treatments in a highly personal book about those years “promise me dad” biden recalled telling obama that he planned to take out a second mortgage to cover the mounting bills “don’t do that” obama said “i’ll give you the money i have it you can pay me back whenever” biden never took him up on it on may 30 2015 beau died at the age of fortysix in his diary biden wrote “it happened my god my boy my beautiful boy”  for years after the car crash biden had talked about it only occasionally he worried how people would respond and vulnerability clashed with the bluff style of his generation now aides saw a change “the whole beau experience just killed off the arrogant stuff” a former colleague told me  in the fall of 2015 biden went on “the late show” hosted by stephen colbert they had some shared experience when colbert was a child his father and two brothers died in a plane crash before the taping they met alone backstage “it was one of the most compact and affecting conversations i think i’ve ever had” colbert told me during the interview biden talked about mourning his son struggling to retain his composure colbert informed by his own experience saw a purpose in putting that anguish in public view “he expresses the loneliness of grief and makes you feel less alone” he told me  advertisement biden’s association with pain and resilience at times puts him outside the usual bounds of retail politics “people come up to him and this is all they want to talk about ‘how do i get through it’ ” mike donilon his chief strategist said when biden and obama worked a rope line biden sometimes took so long that aides had to restart the soundtrack reporters and operatives joked that this was biden’s timeworn shtick lingering too long for pictures and gabbing about his team the phillies people who have worked with him describe it differently “the music will be blaring and people will be screaming for a selfie and some staff person will be pushing him on and he will just stop” donilon said “he will sit there and he will talk to this person”  in the summer of 2017 biden was in semiretirement working to support cancer research and telling anyone in earshot that he could have beaten trump he had considered running in 2016 but was still mourning his son’s death besides he later recalled with evident pique obama was “convinced i could not beat hillary”  that august after white supremacists carried torches through charlottesville virginia biden watched as trump spoke approvingly of the “very fine people” on both sides “i thought holy god this guy is going to be so much worse than i thought he was” biden told me he read “how democracies die” by the harvard political scientists steven levitsky and daniel ziblatt and heard echoes of it in the headlines “look what’s being done look what’s being said not just by him but by his followers and some of his elected colleagues” biden said trump’s actions played on a reservoir of existing anger he thought “it didn’t just happen with trump i’m not even sure trump understands it”  many of biden’s primary opponents—notably sanders and warren—were running forthrightly progressive campaigns a green new deal medicare for all free public college decriminalized borders they were winning widespread support especially among young people by the end of this decade millennials and generation z are on pace to constitute a majority of america’s eligible voters in 2018 twenty millennials were elected to congress including alexandria ocasiocortez a sanders supporter and a democratic socialist who upset a powerful moderate democrat in the bronx but biden believed that his peers had missed a crucial lesson of the midterm elections fortythree house districts had moved from republicans to democrats as some older moderate voters recoiled from trump’s party “we won by not going after the opponent but after the issues underlying what the opponent supported” he told me “they were running against obamacare and all of a sudden you heard them say ‘i didn’t say i was for doing away with that’ ” biden had a chance with some fedup trump voters according to samuel popkin a veteran pollster and the author of “crackup” a forthcoming book on the republican party “farm bankruptcy is near the highest it’s been in thirty years” popkin said in 2018 trump flew to wisconsin promising what he called the “eighth wonder of the world”—a factory to be built for foxconn the taiwanese electronics company “foxconn barely built anything in wisconsin” popkin said  in planning his campaign biden focussed on reforms that stopped well short of revolution instead of medicare for all he wanted to augment obamacare by lowering the medicare eligibility age from sixtyfive to sixty and adding a “public option”—an idea that was considered radical a decade ago but conservative by the new standards his campaign cited polls showing that a majority of potential democraticprimary voters identified as moderate or conservative and more than half were over the age of fifty “the young left is important” anita dunn a top biden adviser told me “but so are older white people above the age of sixtyfive because they actually gave the election to donald trump last time”  in the spring of 2019 just before biden announced his candidacy he ran headlong into his past—and the widening gap in sensibilities between generations lucy flores a former nevada state legislator published an account of a public encounter with him at a 2014 rally in las vegas he had smelled her hair held her shoulders and given her “a big slow kiss on the back of my head” she wrote for years journalists had written about biden’s uninvited displays of affection—bumping foreheads with women and sometimes men rubbing noses whispering awkwardly in people’s ears flores a democrat described feeling “anger” and “resentment” she did not consider biden’s behavior sexual—she has distinguished it from the allegations of assault and misconduct that more than twenty women have made against trump in recent years trump has denied these allegations but flores said biden’s habits showed “a lack of empathy for the women and young girls whose space he is invading” biden who had prided himself on his tactile approach to retail politics responded in a statement that “not once—never—did i believe i acted inappropriately if it is suggested i did so i will listen respectfully but it was never my intention”  at least six women added similar complaints but others came forward to defend him arguing that banishing biden from a race against trump who bragged of grabbing women’s genitals would be an act of misguided absolutism issues of gender flared again later in the campaign after tara reade a former senate staffer accused biden of sexually assaulting her twentyseven years earlier she said that he pinned her to the wall in a senate hallway groped her and penetrated her with his fingers biden emphatically denied the accusation “it never never happened” he said on msnbc some democrats remained unsatisfied biden was seeking to be the standardbearer of a party in which rising progressives disdained not only sex abuse and harassment but also the imbalances of power that had enabled the problems to persist  biden began the race as the frontrunner but he seemed unfocussed and out of step during a debate he botched an invitation to text the campaign at “30330” and instead declared perplexingly “go to joe 30330” rather than eliciting donations it generated a night of twitter memes such as “how do you do fellow kids” in debates he rarely fought back and sometimes yielded the floor with the unfortunate phrase “my time is up” donors backed away by february biden’s campaign was spending less money in a month than michael bloomberg’s spent on an average day kate bedingfield the campaign’s communications director struggled to draw attention to biden’s policy ideas “i say the word ‘achievable’ and it gets derided as ‘that’s not ambitious’ ” she told me  at times biden’s disconnect looked deeper than his wobbly debate performances or his disinterest in social media at a fundraiser in june 2019 he teed up an anecdote he had told for years about working with the segregationist senators herman talmadge of georgia and james eastland of mississippi “we didn’t agree on much of anything” biden said “we got things done we got it finished but today you look at the other side and you’re the enemy” biden added that eastland “never called me ‘boy’ he always called me ‘son’ ”  a magazine cover features stories about people confessing to things cartoon by roz chast one of his rivals senator cory booker of new jersey issued an immediate condemnation “you don’t joke about calling black men ‘boys’ ” booker told me that what frustrated him was not that biden had worked with segregationists “i work with people across the aisle who have beliefs that are offensive and that defend confederate monuments” he said the problem was glibly boasting about it “i did not at that point believe that joe biden understood that when people like my father were called ‘boy’ at work that that would be so humiliating to them” booker said he admires biden which made it worse he told me “it was just one of those moments that many black people feel where you’re just like ‘you’ ” booker was walking out of a cnn studio when biden called to apologize “he was willing to show me a great degree of vulnerability and to put his imperfections on the table” booker recalled “i’ve been in politics a long time—i know when i’m being worked over i’ve watched him change and be willing to wrestle with this”  advertisement biden finished a distant fourth in iowa and fifth in new hampshire the campaign was assessing how much money it would need in order to pay staffers if it shut down biden turned over his senior staff promoting dunn to the top of the campaign and announced a promise to put the first black woman on the supreme court his polls barely budged if he had any hope of staying in the race it would come down to south carolina where black voters make up roughly sixty per cent of the democraticprimary electorate  no one mattered more to that process than james clyburn the highestranking africanamerican in congress and the godfather of south carolina democrats during the civilrights movement he and john lewis had helped found the student nonviolent coordinating committee clyburn holds some distinctly progressive positions on alleviating poverty and expanding community health centers but he believes in hewing to the center when his centrism leaves younger black activists unsatisfied—as happened recently after he tweeted “no to defunding the police”—clyburn points to a display of hundreds of turtle sculptures in his office representing a belief in slow and steady progress  less than a week before the primary clyburn and biden were at a reception aboard the uss yorktown a retired aircraft carrier docked near charleston biden had slid to second place far behind sanders clyburn ushered him into a private room and advised him bluntly that he needed to tighten up “your speeches are senatorial” he said “that’s not the way you win an election” he continued “you got to look at this the way my father the fundamentalist preacher did on sunday mornings he always did it in threes this ain’t the father son and the holy ghost this is about ‘you your family and your community’ ”  his urgency reflected an unapologetic pragmatism biden might not excite people in new york or silicon valley but in south carolina where a white supremacist had massacred black parishioners just after trump announced his candidacy the spectre of four more years of trump was graver than any policy dispute on february 26th clyburn supplied an emotional endorsement “i’m fearful for my daughters and their future and their children and their children’s future” with biden at his side he said “we know joe but most importantly joe knows us”  biden won south carolina by twentynine points with astonishing speed his rivals dropped out and endorsed him there were huge surges in turnout up by nearly fifty per cent in texas and a hundred per cent in virginia including many collegeeducated suburban independents and republicans who had once supported candidates like mitt romney on super tuesday biden won ten out of fourteen states sanders stayed in awhile longer but the race was effectively over  in barely three days biden had gone from the edge of oblivion to victory he had received help not only from clyburn but also from warren who swiftly dispatched bloomberg denouncing his derogatory comments about women yet ron klain one of biden’s closest advisers said that it is wrong to suggest that the turnaround was a fluke—“like he somehow lucked into all this” when biden declined to savage his debate opponents it was “strategic” klain said “if the only way to get the nomination was to destroy all these other people he was going to inherit a party that wasn’t going to win anyway”  a less soaring telling of the primary is that biden benefitted from fear of both donald trump and bernie sanders once it became clear that biden was in a twoperson race the prospect of nominating sanders was so unappealing to moderates—including some fellowcandidates older black voters in places like south carolina and bigmoney donors—that they scrambled to support biden but biden had also prevailed by rejecting tribalism even as his rivals said that he was too old too conciliatory and too tainted by his record he resisted responding with attack ads his advisers believed that biden could prevail over the “doubt in the chattering class” bedingfield said “we’re not going to spend all day trying to win the latest twitter war”  on june 1st a week after the murder of george floyd i walked downtown from my home in dc to a protest in front of the white house after a few nights of unrest in washington the scene had settled into a sitin protesters took turns at a bullhorn  among the homemade signs i noticed a strikingly skillful painting of floyd it was in the hands of kandyce baker a thirtyoneyearold university administrator who had come to the rally from her home in frederick maryland “i had to do something” she told me baker had been especially shaken by the death of ahmaud arbery who in february was tailed by three white men and shot to death while he jogged in a suburb in south georgia as a marathoner and a black woman baker had often run through neighborhoods where she felt unwelcome i asked her about presidential politics “unfortunately i will be voting for biden” she said “bernie sanders was my candidate” she went on “i don’t have faith that joe biden is going to have black issues at the forefront i don’t feel like he’s going to have millennial issues at the forefront when it comes to studentloan debt so i’m nervous”  for biden a rejection by young black and latino voters could be a disaster when hillary clinton ran in 2016 black turnout declined for the first time in two decades in some places such as milwaukee the dropoff proved critical “i’m going to vote for him because i can’t have trump in office” baker said “that’s literally the only reason”  a few hours after i met baker the intersection where we talked was swarmed by police wielding batons and tear gas they were there to sweep away protesters so that trump could walk over from the white house and pose with a bible in front of st john’s episcopal church it was a pageant so roundly condemned that general mark milley the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff publicly apologized for his presence within days the nfl reversed its position on kneeling during the national anthem booksellers across the country were swamped with orders for books about racism and black history mississippi stripped the confederate symbol from its flag  biden seized the moment in a speech on july 4th he urged listeners to “rip the roots” of “systemic racism” out of american life he joined the calls for banning police choke holds adopting a national standard for the use of force and narrowing “qualified immunity” the legal shield that protects public officials against federal civilrights suits biden’s moves thrilled progressives but incensed some police for years he’d maintained cozy relations with the national association of police organizations now its executive director bill johnson lamented that he “used to be a standup guy”  biden leapt ahead in the polls but as ever he was wary of tilting too far to the left as long as trump was inflaming liberals by running an openly racist campaign biden was not going to risk turning off moderate voters trump was already broadcasting a commercial that featured a ringing phone in a dark empty police station the narrator said “if you’re calling to report a rape please press one” the ad ended with trump’s new tagline “you won’t be safe in joe biden’s america”  like most establishment democrats biden rejected “defunding” police a broad term for proposals that range from abolishing departments to moving money toward mental health education and social services he said however that police should receive federal funding only if they met “basic standards of decency and honorableness” and he proposed spending three hundred million dollars to reinvigorate a decadesold idea of “community policing” david kennedy a professor at john jay college of criminal justice told me that he hopes biden adopts a newer approach to violence prevention focussing not on communities but on small numbers of individuals at the highest risk of being involved in gun violence such a program applied nationally “could cut in half the gun violence that devastates america’s minority communities without doing the damage of traditional policing” kennedy said  advertisement when i spoke with biden about the prospects for real change—to incarceration policing and entrenched racism—he offered an analogy to the civilrights era and the iconically cruel police boss of birmingham “when i was a kid in high school bull connor sics his dogs on those elderly black women going to church in their sunday dress and on little kids with fire hoses literally ripping their skin off” he said “he thought he was driving a wooden stake into the heart of the civilrights movement” instead images of the violence consolidated support behind martin luther king jr and forced white leaders in washington to take steps that led to the voting rights act of 1965 in biden’s telling white people in america were now experiencing a similar awakening prompted by the horrific images of police violence captured by cell phones lifting his phone from the arm of the chair he said “this phone has changed a lot of things watching floyd’s face pinned against that curb and his nose being crushed i mean the vividness of it was like ‘holy god that still happens today’ ”  biden said that the year’s events had dismantled a myth deeply embedded in his consciousness for years he’d been telling a parable about the morning of obama’s inauguration “i called my two sons and my daughter up and i said ‘guys don’t tell me things can’t change’ ” hunching forward in his seat he told me that trump had made a mockery of that parable “i’m embarrassed to say i thought you could defeat hate you can’t it only hides” he said “it crawls under the rocks and when given oxygen by any person in authority it comes roaring back out and what i realized is the words of a president even a lousy president matter they can take you to war they can bring peace they can make the market rise they can make it fall but they can also give hate oxygen”  in the usual course of a presidential campaign a democrat leans left during the primary and then marches right in the general election biden went the opposite direction exit polls had revealed a stark warning even in states where he prevailed many voters preferred the more ambitious plans from sanders and warren on issues like the economy and health care  within weeks biden had picked up warren’s plan to ease student debt and overhaul the bankruptcy system—which entailed repealing parts of a law he helped pass he embraced a limited version of sanders’s plan for tuitionfree college and dropped his opposition to federal funding for abortions almost precisely a year after assuring skittish voters that “nothing would fundamentally change” biden said that america was due for “some revolutionary institutional changes”  a rooster gives a hen a set of noisecancelling headphones as a gift “they’re the expensive noisecancelling kind so you can finally sleep in” cartoon by sophie lucido johnson and sammi skolmoski once biden secured the nomination sanders endorsed him—moving far more quickly than he had in 2016 “i have a better relationship with joe biden than i had with hillary clinton” sanders explained candidly to unify their platforms biden and sanders set up task forces on criminal justice economics education health care immigration and climate change the task forces were a crucial test of whether the left and center factions of the party could get along both sides were wary biden told me “i had to be sure that bernie was serious that he wasn’t going to make this an ideological jihad i said ‘bernie if you want these set up in order for me to insist that i be for medicare for all    this is not where it’s going to go’ but i said ‘i’m open i hear you i’m ready to listen’ ”  biden recruited ocasiocortez to chair the climate task force alongside former secretary of state john kerry members included varshini prakash of the sunrise movement which during the primary had graded biden’s climate plan an f at the first meeting kerry asked prakash to speak first the sanders contingent wanted allclean electricity by 2030 they were happy to settle for 2035 the biggest unresolved point of contention was fracking “it’s not like i walked out of there with bernie’s green new deal in hand and i did not expect to” prakash said “but it was a lot more collaborative actually than i was anticipating”  sean mcelwee an influential activist who cofounded the nonprofit think tank data for progress criticized biden fiercely at the outset of the campaign he told me recently that his view had changed “i think a lot of people who just shit on the democratic party haven’t spent a lot of time talking to mainstream actors within the democratic party ecosystem” he said “the reality is that ecosystem is very liberal” he continued “i think people should just take a step back and look at what biden has done aoc is someone i like a lot she said that she wouldn’t vote for him in the primary and that in a different country she would be in a different party from him and he could have responded to that by being like ‘fuck you’ but instead he responded to that by being like ‘how about you come in and write my climate policy’ ”  on a weekday afternoon in late july biden was at a preschool in new castle delaware preparing to talk about economics schools had been closed for months because of the virus on the playground the swings were coiled out of reach inside biden was holding a simulacrum of a campaign event that resembled a scene from an avantgarde play no crowds no rope lines just a scattering of reporters each of us masked and marooned in a white cardboard ring the pa system was playing alicia keys and beyoncé to a silent huddled assemblage  the economic shutdown had produced what jerome powell the chairman of the federal reserve called a “level of pain that is hard to capture in words” forty per cent of the lowincome americans who had jobs in february lost them in march and early april twelve years after the financial crisis the virus had again exploded corporate america’s mythology of selfreliance some of the largest payments in a congressional rescue package intended for small businesses went instead to the financial sector millions of dollars in emergency cash went to “family offices” the personal investment companies that manage fortunes for hedgefund billionaires and other wealthy individuals  biden stepped to the lectern to announce a 775billion investment in the caregiving economy providing funds for universal preschool inhome care for the elderly and paid family leave of the sort that is routine in other developed nations the plan clearly targeted the needs of americans who strain to balance work with caring for children and often aging parents “i was a single parent for five years” biden told the reporters “even though i had a lot more support than a lot of people going through tough times today it was hard” the plan he said was “a moral and economic imperative” it would be funded partly by rolling back trumpera tax breaks for realestate investors aijen poo who leads the national domestic workers alliance tweeted that biden’s proposal marked the first time in twenty years that a presidential candidate had made “investments in the care economy a core strategy in their economic agenda not a side issue an addon or a special interest” a trumpcampaign spokesman responded to the proposal by saying that it would “remake america with socialist policies”  the caregiving plan was the latest in a series of speeches in which biden had called for sweeping economic changes he planned to spend seven hundred billion dollars on american products and research to create jobs around electric cars artificial intelligence and other technologies without the tariffs and the xenophobia of trump’s “america first” policy he had announced a twotrilliondollar cleanenergy and infrastructure plan that would eliminate carbon emissions from power plants by 2035  for all of biden’s rooseveltian zeal it was unclear how far he would go on the explosive issues of wealth taxes and corporate exploitation at a fundraiser in july hosted by investors and executives biden said “corporate america has to change its ways” then he added a comment that inflamed progressives “it’s not going to require legislation i’m not proposing any” when we spoke i asked what he meant no legislation “that is really shorthand” biden said as he explained it america’s corporate establishment has acknowledged the need for fundamental changes he cited the business roundtable a group of corporate ceos which last year announced a shift away from the dominant focus on shareholder value he said “all those people understood that they are eating their own seed corn”  nevertheless he told me that he would push for legislation a measure proposed by warren to forbid companies to use excess revenues to purchase their own stock rather than to invest in wage increases or in research biden said “i’ve been talking with a bunch of my economists saying ‘what are the types of legislation that require greater corporate responsibility’ that has to occur”  i sensed that biden was straining to say as little as possible about his economic vision which could be less a matter of tactical evasion than of ideological uncertainty biden is more than sentimentally attached to the working class and he is embracing some leftist technocratic fixes that would help it but he gives no indication that he is preparing for a bitter costly fight to overturn the primacy of the corporate establishment as maurice mitchell of the working families party put it “we’ve already put trillions of dollars into the economy with bailout after bailout are we propping up systems that have brought us here”  as trump sank in the polls biden reached numbers unmatched by any challenger to an incumbent since the advent of modern polling democrats weighed what would happen if they won biden said that he was seeking to “unify the nation” but what could that mean is the pursuit of unity just a recipe for paralysis  the prospect of unity helped lift obama into the white house but the valence of the concept has changed “obama raised people’s expectations” michael kazin a historian and the coeditor of the leftist quarterly dissent told me “people on the left—to use this tooaggregated term—would say ‘we like what he promised to do but he didn’t follow through’ the question is how much was his fault how much was structural impediments and how much was the timing and what he had to do to save the economy” kazin went on “some of it is because he believed in bipartisanship he thought too much of his own abilities i think to persuade people on the basis of his personality and his rhetoric”  when i spoke to obama he was at his house on martha’s vineyard laboring over his presidential memoir he endorsed biden soon after sanders dropped out and has played a surgical public role in the campaign—appearing alongside the candidate in a video conversation and at a fundraiser he and biden speak frequently by phone though they don’t draw much attention to those exchanges trump after all would love to portray a biden administration as a covert restoration of the obama years  advertisement i asked obama about young people who are dismayed that the democratic establishment has not achieved greater progress he raised the example of health care “joe and i were both painfully aware of some of the constraints and limitations” he said “but it’s what we could get done then and twentyplus million people got health insurance missouri just expanded medicaid so maybe that’s several hundred thousand more and now you have an opportunity to make it that much better so i think one response to the younger generation is yes you should push harder because that’s how progress happens”  obama is touchy about suggestions that his administration was too willing to compromise “my legislative agenda joe’s legislative agenda was at least as bold and aggressive as many of the young people’s agendas right now” he said “if you asked joe and i what regrets we might have or what lessons we learned from my administration it’s not that we were insufficiently bold in what we proposed it’s that we continued to believe in the capacity of republicans in congress to play by the rules and to be willing to negotiate and compromise”  when obama ran for reëlection in 2012 he hoped that a victory would lead to a more amenable congress “the fever may break” he said at the time “because there’s a tradition in the republican party of more common sense than that” that hope is long gone “when i speak to young people i say to them look our climate proposals were very aggressive—we just couldn’t get them passed” he told me “and the reason we couldn’t get them passed was not because lobbyists and corporate donors were whispering in our ears the reason we couldn’t pass them was because we didn’t have sixty votes in the senate and the same is true for getting a public option on health care and getting immigration reform passed” obama went on “through its actions the republican party has discredited the oldstyle negotiations and compromises that existed in congress when joe first came in and it’s probably taken him a little time to let go of that because i think he has experience of being able to get stuff done and i think it’s been painful for him to see what’s happened to institutions like the senate”  biden often says that america “cannot function without generating consensus” but when he conjures the image of congressional harmony many younger americans think that he sounds deluded—or worse unwilling to join difficult fights he was mocked last year for suggesting that members of congress would undergo an “epiphany” after trump was gone to his mind though the prospects for bipartisanship hinge on the margin of victory “if we win and we pick up five or six senate seats i think there will be an epiphany” he told me “because all you need then is three or four or five republicans who have seen the light a little bit” he went on “i don’t think you can underestimate the impact of trump not being there the vindictiveness the pettiness the willingness to at his own expense go after people with vendettas like you saw with sessions”—jeff sessions the former attorney general whom trump had helped torpedo in the recent alabama primary  the senior obama administration official worries that biden’s optimism could be costly “does he see his role as someone who can bring in the never trumpers and build some bipartisan consensus i know from experience that’s a trap we walked right into it your people lose faith the republicans never give you credit you waste a lot of time—and you end up with the tea party”  some analysts believe that biden’s reputation as a centrist could make it easier for him to achieve changes that might seem more threatening coming from a doctrinaire progressive in mcelwee’s research swing voters are more likely to support climatechange action if it is framed as a way to create good jobs and to bring down energy costs  a young woman in therapy complains about not being able to meet anyone at home “i just want to meet someone without using a dating app but also without having to leave my apartment is that too much to ask” cartoon by akeem roberts mike donilon who has advised biden on and off for thirty years told me that biden believes people in washington often negotiate in precisely the wrong way “everyone immediately goes to the bottomline absolute toughest moment in the negotiation they’re like ‘we’ve got to solve this before we solve anything else’ so you don’t solve that—and you don’t solve anything else” he said “it doesn’t mean we compromise on principles but you’ve got to at least see them”  in obama’s view progressives will accept some flexibility if it produces results “i don’t think it is the actual items on the policy checklist that they’re gonna be looking for” he said “what they’re gonna want to see is show us that you can make the machinery of government work to reflect what we believe in and what we care about show us that if the majority of americans support doing something about climate change that you can actually get something done and it doesn’t just get ground down to nothing by the time it gets through the us senate or the us house”  if biden is elected his prescriptions for america’s troubles will be informed by two divergent strands of his biography the myths that undergird the politics of responsibility and his own encounters with misfortune in a new book “the tyranny of merit” the harvard political philosopher michael sandel writes “even as inequality has widened to vast proportions the public culture has reinforced the notion that we are responsible for our fate and deserve what we get    if we succeed it is thanks to our own doing and if we fail we have no one to blame but ourselves” in the age of pandemic and systemic injustice sandel argues “a lively sense of the contingency of our lot can inspire a certain humility ‘there but for the grace of god or the accident of birth or the mystery of fate go i’ ”  biden ever the weathervane is betting that america wants a different politics he understands what goes on in the minds of congress members—the balancing the hedging the triangulation—and he believes that at least a few of them are ready to coöperate with him but his image of unity puts even greater weight on a force beyond the political mechanics of washington the prospect of making people feel as if someone in the capital is listening  every day biden’s aides try to get him on the phone with a regular person one afternoon in april he was patched through to mohammad qazzaz in dearborn michigan three weeks earlier qazzaz who runs a coffeeroasting business had tested positive for covid19 when biden called he was quarantined in his house trying to protect his wife and two children  qazzaz who recorded the call and played it for me told biden that his daughter who is two did not understand why he would not come out of his bedroom “she keeps telling me ‘baba open the door open the door’ ” as he described his situation his voice broke and he tried to steady himself “i’m sorry mr vicepresident” he said  “don’t be sorry” biden said “i think your emotional state is totally justified and as my mom would say you have to get it out”  advertisement biden told qazzaz that he too once had children too small to understand a crisis unfolding around them “nothing is the same but i have some sense of what you’re going through” biden said he suggested that qazzaz play a simple game with his daughter through the door asking her to guess a number or a color “tell her stories about what it’s going to be like when daddy gets better” he said they talked for a while about qazzaz’s father who emigrated from jerusalem “look you’re going to get through this” biden said “we are the nation we are because we’re a nation of immigrants” the call was supposed to last five minutes they talked for twentytwo  listening to qazzaz’s call was reminiscent of roosevelt’s famous line “the presidency is not merely an administrative office    it is preëminently a place of moral leadership” joe biden’s life is replete with mistakes and regrets and if he comes to the presidency he is unlikely to supply much of the exalted rhetoric that reaches into a nation’s soul but for a people in mourning he might offer something like solace a language of healing  for years biden has relied on a small clutch of aides including donilon klain and kaufman—a lineup that politico magazine described last year as “a lot like biden old and white and with long experience in democratic party battles of a bygone era” the portrait ignores the likes of symone sanders a thirtyyearold former bernie sanders aide who is among the most influential black advisers in biden’s campaign but biden recognizes that meeting the needs of the country will require a radical expansion of the people and the experiences represented around him “i think it’s really important—really really important—that my administration look like the country” he said  in august biden picked kamala harris the junior senator from california as his running mate she would be the first black person the first south asian and the first woman to serve as vicepresident at biden’s side for the announcement harris showed a ready appetite for the fray saying of trump’s economy “like everything else he inherited he ran it straight into the ground” and hammering him for the fact that “an american dies of covid19 every eighty seconds” trump and his surrogates struggled to agree on a mode of attack they mocked harris’s voice and her name and in an email to supporters called her “the meanest most horrible most disrespectful most liberal of anyone in the us senate”  harris like biden was never the choice of progressives though she has one of the senate’s most liberal voting records progressives are uncomfortable with many of her choices as a district attorney and as california’s attorney general when she hesitated to make some police reforms and aggressively prosecuted truancy after the announcement i called kandyce baker who had described herself as “unfortunately” supporting biden baker was pleased to have a black woman on the ticket but wary of the political calculations “i’m all for candidates changing their position or recognizing like ‘hey that was 2015 and now i have more information’ but i need kamala to explain what happened” baker said “it’s not enough to just say you’ve evolved”  when harris spoke at the democratic national convention in late august she offered more encouragement than explanations “i’m so inspired by a new generation” she said “you are pushing us to realize the ideals of our nation” the convention like so many things these days was confined to screens but the constraints only accentuated the sense of personal urgency obama presented an appeal to americans especially the young to reject cynicism and apathy “that’s how a democracy withers until it’s no democracy at all and we cannot let that happen” he said in his telling individualism conveyed responsibility not license “do not let them take away your power” he said  it was all a prelude to biden’s sobering case for moral decency for reasonableness for mourning what he called this “season of darkness” in a speech that did not mention trump by name biden argued that americans are not captive to the failures of the past and the present “i will draw on the best of us not the worst” he declared and quoted ella baker the icon of civil rights who said “give people light and they will find a way”  one after another ordinary people attested to enduring hardship kristin urquiza a thirtynineyearold from arizona told the story of her father mark anthony urquiza who had voted for trump believed his assurances about the pandemic and she said “died alone in the icu with a nurse holding his hand” brayden harrington a thirteenyearold from new hampshire gave credit to biden for telling him that they belonged to “the same club—we stutter” the official roll call usually a banal ritual on the convention floor was reborn as a video parade surveying america’s diversity and vastness from the caribbean to the dakotas and alaska the effect was strange and comforting and exhilarating befitting an era in which americans are waking to an unsettling conviction a politician may give us light or at least not obscure it but we must find the way ♦,2

94,few people outside saudi arabia had heard of mohammed bin salman al saud before his father became king in 2015 but now the 35yearold crown prince is considered the de facto ruler of the worlds leading oil exporter  he has won plaudits from western leaders for some of the reforms he has overseen in the conservative gulf kingdom including lifting the ban on women driving and seeking to diversify the economy but he has also been heavily criticised for pursuing a war in neighbouring yemen that has caused a humanitarian catastrophe starting a diplomatic dispute with qatar that has divided the gulf cooperation council gcc and cracking down on dissenting voices there were even calls for him to be replaced as crown prince after the saudi journalist jamal khashoggi a prominent critic of the government was killed by saudi agents at the saudi consulate in istanbul in 2018 he denied any involvement but the murder badly damaged his international reputation  mohammed bin salman was born on 31 august 1985 the eldest son of thenprince salman bin abdul aziz al sauds third wife fahdah bint falah bin sultan  he worked for several state bodies before being appointed special adviser to his father who was serving as governor of riyadh in 2009 mohammed bin salmans rise to power began in 2013 when he was named head of the crown princes court with the rank of minister his father had been appointed crown prince the previous year in january 2015 king abdullah bin abdul aziz died and salman acceded to the throne appointing his son as minister of defence  one of mohammed bin salmans first acts in the post was to launch a military campaign in yemen in march 2015 along with other arab states they intervened after the houthi rebel movement which they saw as an iranian proxy seized control of the capital sanaa and forced president abdrabbuh mansour hadi to flee abroad the campaign has made limited progress over the past five years the fighting has also reportedly left more than 110000 people dead seen saudi arabia and its allies being accused of possible war crimes and triggered the worlds worst humanitarian disaster with millions on the brink of famine  mohammed bin salmans power increased with his appointment in april 2015 as deputy crown prince second deputy prime minister and president of the council of economic and development affairs now in charge of the war in yemen and saudi arabias economy his importance as a policymaker became clear the following year when he unveiled an ambitious and wideranging plan to bring economic and social change to the kingdom and end its addiction to oil  the plan called vision 2030 envisages increasing nonoil revenue to 600bn riyals 160bn â£124bn by 2020 and 1trn riyals by 2030 up from 1635bn riyals in 2015  the plan also involved changing the education curriculum increasing the participation of women in the countrys maledominated workforce and investing in the entertainment sector to help create jobs for young people the prince was also seen as having spearheaded a boycott of fellow gulf cooperation council gcc member qatar in 2017 over its alleged support for terrorism and meddling in its neighbours affairs  charges qatar denies  mohammed bin salmans ascent continued when in june that year king salman replaced the crown prince  his nephew mohammed bin nayef  with his son  the new crown prince subsequently sought to consolidate his power launching a crackdown against perceived opponents more than 20 influential clerics and intellectuals were detained as the authorities targeted a group allegedly acting on behalf of foreign parties against the security of the kingdom when king salman announced despite objections from conservatives that a bar on women drivers would end in june 2018 in saudi arabia  the last country in the world where such a prohibition existed  mohammed bin salman was given much of the credit  this was followed by the crown princes declaration that the return of moderate islam was key to his plans to modernise the kingdom and his launch of a sweeping anticorruption drive  ostensibly aimed at recovering a fortune in illgotten gains many analysts said the purge of powerful princes and business figures removed the final obstacles to mohammed bin salman gaining total control of the kingdom  the mass arrests however unsettled the foreign investors he was counting on to help modernise saudi arabias economy and new foreign direct investment plunged to a 14year low in 2017 womens rights activists were also rounded up shortly before the ban on women driving was lifted  several were accused of serious crimes including suspicious contact with foreign parties  a sign of the saudi leaderships intolerance of criticism despite the appearance of social reforms  mohammed bin salman defended the detention of the activists saying they had misused their right to free speech here we are trying to get rid of extremism and terrorism without civil war without stopping the country from growing he said so if there is a small price in that area its better than paying a big debt to do that move but it was the murder in october 2018 of washington post journalist jamal khashoggi which was to tarnish mohammed bin salmans image abroad the most khashoggi had fled saudi arabia the previous year and written columns critical of the crown prince un special rapporteur agnes callamard said khashoggi was brutally slain inside the saudi consulate in istanbul by a team of saudi agents who dismembered his body and then disposed of it  she concluded that khashoggi was the victim of a deliberate premeditated execution for which the saudi state was responsible she also said there was credible evidence that highlevel saudi officials including mohammed bin salman were individually liable however the saudi government insisted the journalists death was the result of a rogue operation and that the crown prince was not involved in any way mohammed bin salman denied he had ordered the murder but said he took full responsibility especially since it was committed by individuals working for the saudi government  saudi prosecutors put 11 unnamed individuals on trial over the killing five were found guilty and sentenced to death later commuted to life imprisonment three others received jail terms ms callamard called the saudi trial a parody of justice and said the crown prince remained well protected against any kind of meaningful scrutiny saudi kings son mohammed bin salman is new crown prince is saudi arabia on the cusp of change a bali holiday fit for a saudi king saudi king marks year of change saudi arabia country profile first person receives pfizer covid19 vaccine margaret keenan who turns 91 next week becomes the first person

193,logar – a strategic province at the southern gate of the capital kabul – has been among afghanistan’s most insecure provinces for years the government only controls parts of three of its seven districts in some cases not much more than parts of the district centre this provides the taleban positions closer to the capital kabul than almost everywhere else the province’s mineral wealth and drug production is fuelling the conflict even more 2019 and 2020 saw intensified fighting without significant changes in territorial and population control this makes logar an example of what analysts call “statically contested” areas based on interviews carried out between april and midjuly 2020 aan’s thomas ruttig and ali mohammad sabawoon have analysed logar’s trends of insecurity since the last comprehensive report on the province in 2013 exploring the reasons for insecurity they found that residents blame it on poor government leadership while the government blames a lack of cooperation by the population they also found significant popular sympathies for the taleban as the perceived more powerful party in the war   training airstrike by an afghan air force plane in logar province in october 2016 photo wakil kohsar afp kabul’s southeastern gate  logar with its provincial capital pule alam located only about 60 kilometres to the south of the capital kabul is a strategically extremely important province the province’s second largest town muhammad agha is situated only 23 kilometres beyond kabul’s city limits  out of the six rural districts and the one surrounding logar’s capital pule alam the government officially claims to control three the provincial capital khoshai and muhammad agha security analysts and local sources however give a different picture the website of the usbased long war journal with its interactive district control map only considers khoshai under government control it labels pule alam muhammad agha and baraki barak as contested and azra charkh and kharwar up to 2005 part of charkh as under taleban control 1  local sources interviewed by aan confirm this general picture with some differentiation near the provincial capital pule alam taleban are present in many villages just four kilometres from the city villages there were targets of recent afghan government forces’ ‘clearing operations’ in the three southern districts – baraki barak charkh and kharwar – the government only holds the district centres or small areas around them local residents said khoshai was also contested with half of the district controlled by the taleban and half by the government the situation in azra is even more precarious   in october 2019 provincial revenue officials told the afghan pajhwok news agency that they have not been able to collect taxes in five of logars’ districts – all but pule alam and muhammad agha – “due to insecurity”  this degree of control provides the taleban with positions closer to the capital than in almost any other province in 2012 aan called it “a strategic gateway for attacks directed at kabul” together with the pashtuninhabited parts of its western neighbour maidan wardak the province is situated at the northernmost edge of afghanistan’s pashtun south which is still the largest taleban stronghold they are also building up a presence to the northeast north and northwest of kabul in kapisa and laghman provinces and kohe safi of parwan and increasing – though still smallscale – its activity in the shemali and paghman both part of kabul province during the soviet occupation and postsoviet withdrawal years under najibullah 198992 logar had been part of the outer defence ring for the capital  a kabulbased security analyst and former highranking afghan government official told aan the taleban positions in the province might be part of an encirclement strategy for a scenario in which foreign troops withdraw and the country’s capital is up for grabs once more this calls for a closer look at the province and the security situation there  that the province is of strategic importance was reflected by the visit of president ashraf ghani and a highlevel delegation on 1 july 2020 the province’s volatility was underlined by the fact that the taleban hit the provincial capital with eight mortar rounds during ghani’s speech and later after when he departed by helicopter in the days before the taleban had reportedly attacked police posts at the outskirts of the provincial centre  earlier this year on 11 april 2020 residents of a number of districts including residents of pule alam gathered in logar’s capital and called on the taleban to cease their operations stop attacking the afghan army and get ready for peace talks with the afghan government the participants included tribal elders and progovernment people according to this report from salam watandar   map roger helms for aan an introduction to logar province  logar became a separate province in 1964 before some parts of it belonged to kabul province while other parts belonged to ghazni and paktia officially it is considered to be part of central afghanistan but given the local traditions culture and tribal linkages it is more strongly connected to loya greater paktia ie khost paktia and paktika provinces the country’s southeastern region   logar province has seven districts including the one around its capital pule alam for another more detailed map click here baraki barak charkh and kharwar districts are located to the south and southwest muhammad agha to the north and azra and khoshai to the east of the provincial capital logar connects kabul to afghanistan’s southeastern region greater loya paktia through the kabulgardez highway that runs east from the main national ring road and over the tera pass which at almost 3000 meters above sea level is the watershed divide between logar and paktia provinces apart from maidan wardak in the west this province also neighbours nangrahar in the east and ghazni in the south   most of the province’s population lives in the plains of the logar valley which is irrigated by the logar river and its western tributary the wardak river and therefore more fertile this area covers most of the north and west of the province from baraki barak in the southwest to pule alam and muhammad agha its two major population centres in the north a mrrd provincial profile using 201011 figures puts the ruralurban population balance at 72 to 28 per cent according to a 2008 usaid agricultural profile of the province here charkh district ranked highest in terms of agricultural output growing 35 percent of all products in the province followed by baraki barak 28 and pul alam 20 of total crop production charkh produced mainly fruits and vegetables pule alam grain  the logar river a tributary of the kabul river and aquifers under the logar valley are important water sources for the capital kabul aan background here the river however is temporarily falling dry during the summer months at least since 2010 this is due to the increase in land under cultivation for which more and more water is diverted from the river while the natural water table is also falling aan reporting here  the province’s more mountainous east and south are less populated there is also the sorkhab reservoir in muhammad agha district to the east of the district’s centre  the province’s eastern southeastern and southern parts – around one third of its total territory – are mountainous and less populated azra the province’s northeasternmost district in the spinghar mountain range is almost completely mountainous agriculture including livestock production trade and stone quarrying are the population’s main commercial activities  the majority of the population are pashtun by ethnicity while smaller numbers of tajiks and hazaras also present two districts kharwar and azra are entirely pashtuninhabited according to un figures charkh has a tajik majority of approximately 75 per cent in the remaining districts the tajiks are between 20 pule alam and 40 per cent baraki barak mainly in the district centre a media report here of the population some of these tajiks are shia hazara and sayyed communities who are entirely shia here live in khoshai 25 per cent of the population district and small groups in the provincial capital and baraki barak the mrrd profile quoted above gives a 6040 pashtodari language ratio  among the pashtuns the sulaimankhel – part of the ghilji pashtun tribal confederacy – are dominant in all but kharwar district the incumbent president muhammad ashraf ghani and a prominent member of the political office of the taleban in qatar mullah muhammad abas stanakzai are both from logar province and belong to the sulaimankhels’ ahmadzai and stanakzai subtribes respectively kharwar has an andar ghilzai majority there are also momand ludin kharoti alozai most of them kuchis and wardak pashtuns  the official afghan poverty rate for logar was given at 38 per cent in 201112 and 461 per cent in 201617 here p10 the 201617 figure would make logar the least poor province in the country afghanistan’s average is 554 per cent the afghan government however uses its own lower poverty line than that internationally applied the latter puts the country’s rate at 80 per cent see here p9 this relatively positive ranking is put in doubt by two statements in the same document p15 that logar is both among the provinces with the highest deprivation of school attendance and for assisted deliveries figures from the afghanistan statistical yearbook 201819 put logar seventh from bottom of all provinces in terms of government revenues collection p245 which corresponds with its ranking in the population sixth from bottom this figure however could have been expected higher if poverty is comparatively low in 2018 the province’s director for education admitted that 40000 girls were deprived of education see also this 2015 afghan media report about ghost schools and teachers in logar logar is also among the eight provinces with the with the highest burden of conflictrelated trauma see here p61  logar is home to several important military installations this includes an afghan army base camp maiwand at patkhab to the south of pule alam and on the strategically important connecting road to maidan wardak province and a training area for police special forces a 2018 photo here the army base is adjacent to the former us military’s forward operation base shank with over 8000 us soldiers contractors and civilian personnel making it one of the largest in the country 2 but handed over to the afghan side during the military transition in 2014 camp maiwand reportedly had “a fifth” of that in march 2019 a us journalist saw the former us military base in a state of severe disrepair next to it however new us military installations were established according to a us media report a “us special forces camp and an american outpost called camp dahlke west” see another media report here and aan reporting here   in moghulkhel village in muhammad agha district there is a base of the 333rd special forces unit under the ministry of interior which according to police spokesman shapur ahmadzai does not take part in the fighting of other government forces and launches its own operations without sharing its plans with the provincial government the area is also a taleban stronghold with a taleban ‘martyrs’ graveyard located only 200 metres away from the 333rd base taleban killed in the muhammad agha are buried here and a madrasa with around 100 boystudents also called taleban seen by locals as a kind of protaleban motivation centre 3  there is also a base of the nds special forces 01 unit in the province see aan resources here according to ahmadzai there are afghan local police alp units in pule alam muhammad agha baraki barak azra and khoshai district like the uprising forces residents perceive the alp negatively as they say they “bother” the local population they cite various examples in which the alp have killed civilians despite as the residents said they were neither taleban nor linked with them the residents said the alp behaviour caused a number of people to join the taleban in various districts  longterm security trends  a 2007 un provincial profile had already labelled four districts of logar kharwar charkh baraki barak and parts of muhammad agha as “problematic” securitywise it gave a mix of reasons tribal and factional hezbe islami marginalisation 4 conflict over drug trade routes and insurgent activity early armed insurgent network had overwhelmingly hezbe islami roots the taleban’s haqqani network expanded there since 2008 see also this new york times report a wellknown criminal network involved in abductions was operating from zarghunshahr in the east of muhammad agha district aan reporting here  in july 2007 two afghan staff members  of the international rescue committee were killed and in august 2008 three female expat staff members and their afghan driver of the same usbased ngo were killed along the kabulgardez road in logar in charkh district and muhammad agha district respectively the taleban reportedly took the responsibility for the 2008 attack in 2008 a selfdeclared taleban splinter group fedayi mahaz claimed the kidnapping in logar of new york times journalist david rohde and his afghan driver and translator the group also claimed the assassination of logar’s provincial governor arsala jamal in october 2013 aan background here  by 2009 the un only considered the provincial capital and those parts of muhammad agha that are close to the highway as accessible during the presidential poll in 2009 the taleban were already able to threaten election workers throughout the province leading a local inhabitant to tell aan that “there were no elections in logar” aan reporting here and here when one of the authors went to gardez for election reporting that year he was only able to go there in a heavily guarded convoy with logar being the most dangerous part of the journey on that part of the road there were many ied craters blown up culverts and patches of blackened asphalt from cars set alight  journalists writing for the global post described the same stretch of the road in 2012 with culverts being blown up “at regular intervals each one an ideal place to hide a bomb aimed at passing military convoys” they reported that the taleban were running “an informal judicial system that is generally regarded as cleaner and faster than the official courts” and that the local population provided the insurgents with “food a place to stay and pray for them” they also quoted a local high school student as saying that even his teachers used taleban songs as the ringtones on their cell phones  in 2012 the us defence ministry had ranked logar consistently among the top eight insecure provinces of afghanistan during the last five years and the district around pule alam amongst the ten most violent districts countrywide aan background here aan found that insurgent activity started to pick up in 2011 up to then it had mainly consisted of guerrillastyle ambushes then the number of largerscale attacks increased this included complex attacks against government offices in the provincial capital and several district centres and afghan and international forces’ bases for example see media reports here here here here here and here assassinations and kidnappings became “daily news in addition to increasing numbers of victims being caught up in the fighting between afghan national security forces and insurgents” 5 since april 2011 the taleban were also closing down phone networks in logar at night see aan background in october 2018 taleban reportedly attacked the guards of the provincial governor halim fedayi in pule alam and captured their humvee vehicle  in june 2011 the province had experienced the first suicide carbomb attack against a civilian hospital in azra district 29 people were killed – amongst them 15 children waiting for immunisation and five toddlers – and 53 wounded the hospital’s tenbed maternity ward was completely destroyed by then it was the thirdmost destructive terrorist attack in post2001 afghanistan aan reporting here  in late 2014 mps and provincial council members from logar said that “most parts of charkh kharwar and azra districts are under the control of the armed opponents” according to a media report see also aan reporting here our report from logar in the same year continued from logar’s district closest to kabul describing the situation as follows  today most villages of mohammad agha district even at daytime are eerily calm… roaming groups of taleban are patrolling the district and regularly knock on doors to ask for food if villagers in this district … refuse to help they risk being marked as spies of the government and punished … in some villages families left behind their houses and headed to kabul… the taleban sometimes planted people to occupy these homes as spies  people from the province who regularly commute between there and kabul told aan that many members of the afghan armed forces had joined the taleban after the end of their contracts  in 201415 the province briefly featured a group of islamic state supporters led by a former afghan taleban commander accordng to a pajhwok report by july 2015 this group had been pushed out of logar and likely relocated to nangrahar aan background here according to a june 2019 un report p14 later “attempts to expand into … logar …have failed” 6  over the following years kabulbased international security analysts have registered further “substantially“ increased conflict activity in logar with peaks in 2018 and 2019 october 2018 brought the highest levels of insurgent activity recorded since “at least 2011” according to the security analysts in kabul  in 2019 taleban activity particularly increased along the logar part of the kabulgardez highway pule alam and muhammad agha districts combined accounted for 76 per cent of all taleban attacks that year this led to increased counteroperations by afghan and international troops in autumn of 2019 including “unprecedented” levels of airstrikes and night raids along the highway but also against taleban logistic structures deeper in the province and particularly against insurgent networks operating from logar into kabul as a result the analysts registered the “highest level” of monthly conflict intensity on record in july 2019 although this had somewhat “diminished” taleban operational capacities there were still between over 40 and over 60 taleban attacks per months from may to september 2019 on average this was ten less than in 2018 when the season of significant fighting was longer from april to october    afghan men gather at the site of a us air strike in dashtebari village in logar province on 30 august 2017 13 people from the same family were killed and another 15 wounded afghan authorities said on august 31 photo faridullah ahmadzai afp the current security situation district overview   in 2020 logar appeared to have had an upanddown in the intensity of fighting after the slight decrease of taleban attacks but not general fighting in the province in 2019  a drop in intensity of fighting over the winter 201920 and the week of reduced violence before the signing of the ustaleban deal in late february 2020 local residents in pule alam and in the districts told aan that since the beginning of the new afghan year and the start of the ‘spring fighting season’ in the country in late march the taleban have intensified attacks on government security posts throughout all districts of the province as well as in the outskirts of the provincial capital and on a stronger scale than in any other year since the insurgency started in this province according to them they have rarely experienced a day or two in which the taleban have not carried out an attack   a tribal elder in charkh district told aan that some years ago he had invited the district governor and other officials to his home around 35 kilometres away from the district centre and the district governor had indeed come but now he said the district governor could not come to his district centre without a huge number of armed forces protecting him  this trend has been confirmed by the kabul based security analysts quoted above who said that the number of security incidents in march this year was three and a half times more numerous in logar province than in march 2019 april and may saw large afghan forces operations airstrikes and targeted snatches in several districts in the first half of may – during ramadan – the taleban increased their attacks against the usual trend during this month in earlier years   the analysts also said that after the governmenttaleban prisoner release picked up again in june logar belonged to a list those provinces that experienced a “moderate decline” in fighting at the same time they put muhammad agha among the 25 districts with the highest number of incidents countrywide  also the wave of assassinations of people working in the current political system continued over the entire period the most highprofile case was the kidnapping and shooting of former senator abdul wali ahmadzai on his way from a funeral in the provincial capital back to his home area chowni a village in pule alam on 9 june 2020 ahmadzai was currently with the independent directorate of local governance idlg a spokesman for the provincial governor accused the taleban of the killing in march a member of the logar provincial council was assassinated in kabul and in early june the taleban shot dead two sisters one of them reportedly the wife of an intelligence official at the ministry of interior the other a visitor on 6 july nafisa hejran a female provincial council pc member and her driver were wounded in a shooting in the provincial capital her pc colleague nasir ghairat along with three guards was killed in kabul on 8 march   most disconcertingly for the residents often times no group claims responsibility for these incidents most residents of logar that aan spoke with however believe that the taleban are behind the recent killings of local civilians as a reaction to rejected demands for money or other kinds of assistance in the case of ghairat for example aan heard accusations that the government might be involved in this case the same goes for the case of civil society activist qudratullah stanakzai shot dead and thrown in the river in pule alam on 29 march 2020 according to a fellow activist he was progovernment but was also criticising government activities and negligence in logar a fellow activist told aan that no group had claimed responsibility for his killing but that he and his civil society colleagues knew the taleban did not kill him he said “we are sure that he was murdered by some people inside the government these people do not want people like qudratullah to raise their voice against them or the provincial government at large”   a district roundup  the northern districts pule alam and muhammad agha  in recent weeks the area around the provincial centre pule alam has witnessed many taleban attacks and government forces’ counteroperations among the largerscale incidents was a 4 april taleban attack on a check post manned by local ‘uprising forces’ in the shairwazi area of pule alam according to the provincial governor’s spokesman five members of the public uprising forces were reportedly killed during in the attack  the taleban are also able to carry out assassinations in the city on 6 april for example they killed an officer of the criminal investigation unit along with two other police in the middle of the city and took their vehicle see a facebook post from a government source confirming the incident on the following day they taleban reportedly ambushed a police vehicle in the bargains area of pule alam and killed three police officers on 29 april zabihullah mujahed the spokesman for the taleban wrote on twitter that their fighters had killed four officers of the afghan national directorate for security in the patkhawe shahna area of the provincial capital and destroyed their vehicle this allegation has not been confirmed by officials and local residents  residents of pule alam told aan that the taleban have been able to launch attacks on the government security posts whenever they want which was made easier by their presence close to the provincial capital the taleban keep a large presence in villages only four to five kilometres away such as kamalkhel darokhel dadokhel muhajerin hesarak babos and porak around the pule alam some of these villages were targets of government forces clearing operations during may june and july 2020 for example a media report here  in muhammad agha district with its centre located 40 kilometres to the south of kabul on the logarkabul highway many areas are under taleban control as local residents told aan apart from their frequent attacks on the ainak copper mine still under development 7 residents said the taleban have been for a long time now able to temporarily block the highway leading to kabul and attack and abduct government officials and ngo employees from vehicles they stop as already described there is some proximity of government forces and taleban positions in areas with chromite mines  the district’s sorkhab area is the ancestral home of the family of current president ashraf ghani tolonews reported in 2019 that sorkhab village had been under “taleban influence for years” and the taleban claimed they were taxing the family’s land   a village at sorkhab reservoir logar in winter 2005 photo thomas ruttig the kabulgardez highway  taleban attacks along the logar part of this highway leading through muhammad agha and pule alam districts threaten not only the government and ngo employees of logar province but those travelling to and from paktia paktika khost and kabul provinces the taleban have a presence along almost the whole stretch of the highway particularly in the waghjan gorge of muhammad agha district and in the kolengar and porak areas of pule alam near logar’s provincial boundary with kabul they regularly block the highway and pull people from vehicles whom they suspect are government or ngo employees travellers passing through waghjan can easily see the white flags of the taleban on the lefthand side of the road when travelling from kabul as a result government officials such as the provincial governor and other highranking officials cannot travel to and from logar without a large escort of security forces   the latest of such incidents occurred when on 20 june the taleban stopped and burnt an oil tanker in the area of ali khan qala logar officials said it belonged to civilians while residents said that it was government tanker see a video here in april the taleban had pulled a traffic officer—who was travelling to kabul from logar province—from his vehicle and killed him as a local journalist in logar told aan in two highprofile earlier cases the taleban killed qamaruddin shakayeb the deputy governor of logar province along with a provincial spokesman the head of courts and eight police in an ambush in waghjan in april 2018 and in october 2019 the taleban pulled four paktia provincial judges—travelling to kabul—from a vehicle and killed on the spot according to a ariana news report  the southern districts  baraki barak district with its centre located around 18 kilometres to the southwest of pule alam has heavy taleban presence and activity residents told aan that the government controls only the district centre while all other areas of the district have fallen into the taleban’s hands the insurgents attack government convoys and operate recruitment centres and even jails there haji mir zaman a local tribal elder told aan that for at least one and a half years the taleban have not allowed anybody in the district to seek government assistance in terms of public service delivery but that last winter the taleban at least allowed civilians to go to the district centre to get tazkeras identification cards the district with its strong tajik minority used to be strongly progovernment but according to a local another tribal elder when the taleban overran all of the security posts in this area last year the local tajiks had to give up their opposition to the taleban out of fear he told aan on 6 may that the day before the government forces after a severe clash with the taleban had evacuated their last security post in the district tribal elders also said that the army and police mainly take care of the district centre in late aprilearly may there were several statements from the logar governor’s office and the local 203rd “tander” army corps that the taleban were planning to attack the district centre but that the government forces had discovered the plan and attacked the taleban first with the help of air support on 1 may they claimed that 15 taleban fighters were killed and six others wounded see report and killing ten taleban and wounding 13 others on 5 may security analysts based in kabul reported however that on 5 may government forces had attacked a “funeral ceremony” attended by taleban in the district leading to 23 casualties  a tribal elder said “the district governor along with the district governors of charkh and kharwar is sitting in the provincial capital” – an indication of how dangerous baraki barak district has become the district governor ahmad wais abdul rahimzai denied this and told aan on 5 may that he was in the district and had not been home for two weeks he is from muhammad agha district even if he were in the district locals said that security in the district was not good enough to work outside the district compound a civil society activist who is a close friend of the district governor told aan on 20 june that the district governor had been in kabul for the last one and a half months at that point  on 25 april a journalist from logar province told aan that charkh district was almost entirely under taleban control he said the government had only a military presence mostly from the ana and very few national police in the district centre a tribal elder from the district said there was also a government security post in the area of dabaro pul at the boundary with pule alam district mp momand told aan that the district compound is the only active government presence in the whole district with the taleban controlling 90 per cent of the district according to the journalist already quoted and a tribal elder known to be strongly progovernment the district governor is based in the provincial capital where he issues tazkeras to people who travel there from charkh this was confirmed by a tribal elder from baraki barak district governor khalilullah kamal told tolonews on 9 april “unfortunately we have failed to provide services to the public”  momand also told aan on 20 june that the former provincial governor had a plan to move the district offices to the altemur area of pule alam but that the new governor had ordered that there should be a civilian government presence in the district under all circumstances  a tribal elder from the district told aan that the provincial governor of the taleban’s shadow government his deputy and head of the military commission are all present in the charkh district he also said that all people arrested or abducted by the taleban throughout logar were kept in charkh district   on 18 april the communication office of the ministry of defence said in a press release that it had retaliated with airstrikes against taleban for its attacks on the charkh district centre two days before during which nine national police had been killed some sources had told the media that the number was over 20 the airstrikes reportedly killed ten insurgents and wounded 17 more including the commander of the taleban group that had attacked this was followed by a larger government forces operation later that month with claims of 40 killed insurgents and 16 others wounded   kharwar with its centre located around 45 kilometres to the south of the provincial capital like in charkh has only a military presence most of the time the army and police remain in the district centre called khwaja angur which is still in government hands according to the kabul based journalist mentioned above and a tribal elder from the district the district governor resides in the provincial capital and there is no public service delivery by district officials in kharwar the tribal elder also said that the only government security post in khwaja angur is a onehour drive from the kharwar bazaar which itself was under control of the taleban the situation of the district centre is precarious on 30 april the media office of logar province said that taleban insurgents attacked the district compound but that the government forces pushed back the attack and killed 13 insurgents  the eastern districts  khoshai dari khoshi is considered the most secure district of logar province it has boundaries with pule alam muhammad agha azra and with the jaji district of paktia province the district is divided into four howza the taleban are present in two of them karezuna and kandaw while the government fully controls the payan dai and bala dai   according to residents the main reason behind the comparatively good security is the presence of a significant shia population around 35 per cent in payan dai and miana dai who according to the residents are progovernment a government official who works in khoshai district told aan that public service delivery is provided in all areas even those under taleban control he said that when government employees go to monitor a project the local tribal elders must work to guarantee that the taleban will not arrest beat or kill them an ngo employee who works in khoshai district told aan that they like the government workers also need written permission from the taleban to work there   may 2020 also saw a security forces’ antitaleban operation in the fatehkhel area of khoshai killing a subcommander of 15 taleban along with four other fighters according to a press release by the logar police on 24 june taleban attacked an alp post in the sarband area of khoshai district killing four of its members  azra district located to the east of the provincial capital and which had been part of paktia province until 2005 9 is particularly volatile amended 20 july it is not clear whether the district borders directly on pakistan as our maps show or – as local sources say – its easternmost tip is a dozen kilometres away from parachinar in the pakistani tribal agency of kurram and paktia’s zazi aryub is located between azra and pakistan from parachinar through zazi aryub azra and further on through kabul’s khake jabar district of kabul province runs a direct route to the afghan capital this was a much frequented route already during the mujahedin’s struggle against the soviet occupation 197989 and is currently used by the taleban  the taleban have besieged the district centre for the last 15 years a schoolteacher in azra district told aan that the government only controls an area that extends around five kilometres in all directions from the district centre still government forces and civilian officials cannot travel between the provincial capital and azra district the government supplies its local offices by air delivery and the local people who need to go to pule alam must make a long detour first through eastern nangrahar province then to kabul and then from kabul to pule alam   taleban and government forces have very recently clashed in this area resulting in the death of civilians caught in the crossfire according to the teacher mentioned above on 9 may the media office of the logar police reported that the taleban launched a mortar shell which hit a house in the salimkhel area of the district the mortar shell killed a child and injured three other civilians report here    bazaar in the provincial capital pule alam in winter 2005 photo thomas ruttig the major reasons for insecurity in logar  residents of logar province and various local sources cite various factors as the major causes for the worsening insecurity in this province and for the local people’s increased resentment of the government this includes the strategic importance of the province already described the hashish and chromite smuggling and the fight over its control and widespread local sympathy for the taleban residents of logar particularly local civil society activists and some journalists also citewhat they see as the recruitment of incapable andor inexperienced and corrupt highranking provincial government officials and a lack of coordination among the government’s security forces  fighting over hashish and chromite smuggling  narcotics and chromite smuggling and the fight for control over it has significantly contributed to the insecurity in logar province the chromite and part of the drugs shipments hashish in particular are from the province but logar and particularly azra district is also used as a transit route for narcotics from elsewhere  logar’s main mineral resource is the massive mes ainak copper mine in muhammad agha district but it is still in an early development stage and the government controls the area with specially dedicated armed forces despite regular attacks khaled momand an mp from logar said that around 1800 security personnel are present for the protection of mes ainak mine ahmadzai the province’s police spokesman confirmed that there is a regiment ghund based in muhammad agha under the interior ministry’s directorate of public security mu’inate mohafezate ama which does not take part in fighting and does not support other military forces in the province   in contrast to the ainak copper several chromite deposits in the districts of muhammad agha pule alam and baraki barak are under extraction see this report and aan background here here and here the total reserves of chromite in logar and khost are reported to be one million tonnes according to this 2017 usip report private operators have been extracting the ore under exploration licenses from the ministry of mines and petroleum it said such contracts were also awarded for mines located in the dadokhel area of muhammad agha district and that this mine “according to residents is controlled by a sitting mp” while “fifty​two smaller chromite sites in logar province are being illegally exploited”  for hashish azra district is the major cultivation area at least from the late 1980s according to a 1989 unhcr report sharecroppers from sayed karam district in paktia expanded cannabis cultivation to cover more than 50 per cent of all the agricultural lands of azra district and up to 80 per cent of those of the dubandi valley of khoshi district the district is famous for hashish cultivation all over afghanistan its produce however is considered to be of comparatively lower quality aan background here in 2016 pajhwok afghan news quoted logar provincial council member abdul wali wakil as saying that 80 per cent of azra’s arable land was planted with hashish one civil society activist in pule alam and a teacher in azra district told aan the percentage was even higher now they put it at 90 and “more than 95 per cent” respectively  residents said that on top of the regular taleban practice of collecting a ten per cent tax on all products as ushr they now also ‘tax’ the smuggling of drugs and chromite which mainly goes through azra and jaji maidan to pakistan residents in logar said that the drug mafia and some government officials and police chiefs—as well as the taleban—are involved in smuggling both chromite and hashish from logar to other provinces many residents believe that the taleban have intentionally made some of logar’s districts insecure in order to safeguard their smuggling business  the taleban have been collecting this money from the drug mafia and chromite smugglers for the last eight years but the ordinary residents did not know about the taleban collecting money from drug mafia and smugglers the public have known about this practice since about two years ago   residents told aan that the taleban do not encourage people to grow hashish but also do not prevent it or raise the fact that this practice is illegal under the sharia according to a pajhwok report the taleban collected 10000000 pakistani rupees around usd 66700 as tax from the harvest of hashish in 2016 from the whole district aan has not found more recent figures in the same year district officials said that the smugglers paid 20000000 pakistani rupees around usd 13350 to the heads of the taleban in peshawar to allow them to continue smuggling hashish from azra residents said that the smugglers are from the eastern provinces and also from abroad but are assisted by local people  the taleban’s lax attitude visàvis the hashish cultivation seems to be motivated by their fight against the local chapter of the islamic state the iskp in late 2016 tribal elders of azra district decided that if any member of a family from the residents joined iskp his house would be burnt and his family would be banished from the district according to aan local sources the taleban pushed for this decision while the district governor reportedly claimed it was the tribal elders’ initiative azra is adjacent to the iskp’s strongholds in nangrahar province – see aan background here as an incentive the taleban promised to give full exemption in their hashish tax if the residents carried out the antiiskp the plan recently as mansur a resident of muhammad agha district told aan the logari taleban had significantly contributed to defeating daesh iskp in nangrahar province by sending many of their fighters there  regarding chromite one resident from moghulkhel village told aan that the taleban take 100000 pakistani rupees usd 630 per truck of chromite to allow the smugglers to pass see also this pajhwok report he said that the same amount is given to the village maleks when the trucks pass through security and civilian government officials apparently also take their share this has been confirmed by ministry of mines officials as early as in 2012 as quoted in this report residents said that in the past when people objected to these illegal businesses landmines were planted in front of their houses to deter their objections aan was told about one case in moghulkhel village of muhammad agha district where the gates of some houses were blown up at night in 2011 they believed the taleban behind this a resident of this village told aan that many residents left the area afterwards  alleged poor recruitment of government officials  a kabulbased civil society activist originally from logar province told aan that activists have been pushing president ashraf ghani for years to hire capable highranking officials for logar province and to remove governor halim fedayi who has served there since 2015 a logar mp and provincial officials also complained over “incompetent” government officials when governor fedayi was removed in february 2018 muhammad anwar eshaqzai came into office but the civil society activist said he was even weaker than the previous governor   the provincial governor spends three days in logar and four days in kabul he comes to logar on sunday and goes back early on wednesday to kabul he is incapable all his activities are handled by khaled safi the head of his office  eshaqzai did not last long in may 2020 ajmal shapur was appointed in his place see this idlg’s facebook post 8 during his introductory meeting shapur said that his first job would be to secure the province it remains to be seen whether he will be able to do better a civil society activist told aan that he had resumed the monthly provincial administration meetings shapur that his predecessor was not conducting he thought though that because shapur’s lack of a military background he would likely not be able to improve security in the province  also logar mp khaled momand told aan that the government was continuously sending incompetent officials to the province he described rahim khoda mokhles the former police chief a former “jihadi commander” linked to jamiate islami as “unprofessional” and ”unfamiliar with the area and with the people” he demanded that highranking officials for logar or at least their deputies should be from logar spokesman ahmadzai also told aan that the former police chief was “not a professional” mokhles has been transferred and replaced by ahmad faisal allahdad on 28 june 2020 he has already taken up his position the new police chief is from kabul has graduated from the police university and worked before as a police commander in herat nimruz nangrahar and paktia provinces as well as the commander of the third zone of kabul and of police district 01 in kabul  in the runup to the 1 july 2020 presidential visit around one week earlier defence minister asadullah khaled had visited logar didar lawang spokesman of the provincial governor told aan on 18 june that khaled had called logar a “priority of the government” and that it would work for the improvement of its security lawang said that shapur had demanded the minister to dedicate the afghan national army’s fourth brigade lewa for the province the brigade currently covers both logar and maidan wardak shapur had also asked him for additional military posts to secure the kabullogar highway and in villages with a taleban presence apart from the shared brigade logar has 1800 members of the afghan national police and the alp in its structure also including the criminal and tourism police according to police spokesman ahmadzai he said when the support staff is deducted from this total only 700 police remain for fighting  on the positive side logar became the first province with a female vice governor following a presidential decree foreseeing this for all 34 provinces on 9 july 2020 rabea stanakzai was appointed for this post   rabea stanakzai appointed logar deputy governor in june 2020 photo hashte sobh lack of coordination between the security forces  both mp momand and a logarbased journalist told aan they believed that the lack of proper coordination among military officials had caused the province to become more insecure momand said that when for example the taleban attacked police posts the army did not go to support them in the fighting and “when the army is attacked the police say ‘it is army let them fight on their own’”  momand and the journalist cited the example of the moi regiment assigned to protect the mes ainak mine that was unsuccessful in doing so momand said that he along with other mps from logar had complained to the interior minister after 17 may when the taleban overran a security post in mes ainak of muhammad agha district for the “seventh time”   khaled momand said the minister promised around three months ago that he would bring changes in the setup of the police and it looks as if he recently fulfilled his promise by introducing the new provincial police chief however the police spokesman rejected the accusation that there was a lack of coordination among the security forces   people’s sympathies for the taleban  there are several reasons why many residents of logar have a certain sympathy for the taleban and why according to some residents they have contributed a large number of fighters to the taleban a logar resident told aan that local taleban ranks have been increased over recent years by former aan and anp members who did not extend their contracts it is not clear though how much of this was voluntary or the result of coercion – the taleban are able to pressure families when their sons return to their villages of origin – or whether this includes infiltration in order to obtain military training  the civil society activist said he thinks this is due to the “abnormal situation” of war he said people witness that when a government soldier is killed he or his family are not taken care of by the government but if a taleban fighter is killed the taleban very soon write poems praising him and his bravery is sung everywhere he said this contributes to pulling parts of the young generation toward the taleban he said under normal conditions everyone would prefer the presence of the government  already in 2012 the global post article quoted earlier had reported that those who were willing to be interviewed for it were “happy to express their admiration for the taliban while many others are scared of talking to a journalist” its authors quoted local people accusing the police of discriminating against “bearded villagers who come into town wearing traditional afghan clothes” and that as a result the police were seen as “our oppressors and our enemies” and “everyone” supported the “jihad” against them  at a higher level the fact that the taleban’s political office in qatar includes two prominent representatives from logar mullah abas stanakzai and mawlawi shahabuddin delawar also contributes to a level of grassroots support ie pride in being represented  almost all the respondents quoted in this text told aan that the increasingly abusive behaviour of government security forces – including the uprising forces and alp aan background here – have caused the people to be sympathetic to the taleban which in turn further enforced their presence in logar for example some residents said that around three days before eid on 21 may 2020 the shopkeepers closed their shops asking the government to stop the uprising forces who according to them beat people accusing them of supporting the taleban that had attacked the uprising forces from their areas as a reaction logari officials said in a whatsapp group that the new governor went to the area and convinced the shopkeepers to keep open their shops in turn the governor’s spokesperson lawang said that a reason for the insecurity in the province was the lack of cooperation from local residents he said that the people did not cooperate with the government out of fear for the taleban    children in sorkhab photos thomas ruttig 2005 conclusion  for the taleban logar’s strategic importance lies in its proximity to kabul together with consolidated positions in neighbouring provinces such as maidan wardak western nangrahar and sarobi the easternmost district of kabul where fighting had increased recently logar is part of a belt that could cut off the capital from southern and eastern afghanistan if the military situation  escalates into an endgame scenario in logar itself they have been able to regularly attack the government forces in both the provincial capital and the districts the province also provides them with access and supply routes to areas more to the west such as maidan wardak and central afghanistan   according to residents of logar and local analysts there are several reasons for the continued insecurity throughout the province apart from the taleban’s resilient local structures incompetent high government officials a lack of proper coordination among security forces the struggle over control of the narcotics and chromite smuggling and government security forces’ harassment of local people even without clearcut territorial advances the position of the taleban seems to improve in such a situation   the taleban also have obtained informal authority over ngo activity and there are signs that parts of the population sympathise with them out of fear or resignation or because of weak governance and government forces’ harassment that pushes locals into the insurgency population control might even exceed territorial control  with over the recent six years increasing and then peaking fighting activity in 2019 and ups and downs in 2020 but without much change in territory and population control by the parties to the war logar is an example of what security analysts call “statically disputed” territory the lack of success of government troops’ ‘clearance operations’ indicates that taleban strictures in the province as resilient that fighting is still intensive seems to indicate that the parties have to do more to hold their particular shares this is a characteristic situation in many parts of the country   edited by martine van bijlert and christian bleuer  1 doublechecking securityrelated facts with officials proved difficult aan tried to talk to three district governors of logar they either rejected the requests claiming that the provincial authorities have forbidden them to provide information to the media or they provide information that was obviously incorrect for example some of them said that they control their whole district one military official’s spokesman rejected a request to provide the number of security forces existing in the province according to the tashkil official structure he said “we have received a letter signed by the defence minister and the chief of army staff which reads that we are not allowed to share any kind of information to the media until the talks between the government and the taleban resume”  2 the report described it as having an “americanbuilt runway allowing huge cargo planes to bring in troops weapons and equipment” and with “a 50shop bazaar four beauty salons three restaurants and an academy to train soldiers in the counterinsurgency doctrine”  3 local residents told aan that the madrasa is led by two disabled mullahs mufti khaled and mawlawi ghulam hazrat according to their reports the madrasa was raided by the government and both of the organisers of the madrasa were taken by the government forces around one and half years ago but both were later released due to the pressure of the tribal elders of this area  aan uses taleban capitalised for the members of the movement and taleban when used in the traditional sense for madrasa students more about this in a book chapter by james caron  4 up to mid2007 the provincial governors came from hezb’s rival jamiate islami which also largely controlled the province’s administration  5 some of the more prominent cases after the october 2013 killing of provincial governor jamal are listed here based on media reports  august 2014 taleban attack the home of muhammad agha mayor saifullah and shoot him dead during the firefight october 2014 ghufran an afghan local police alp commander in the kolangar area of muhammad agha killed by a magnetic bomb attached to his vehicle on his way to the provincial capital november 2014 sabz ali alp chief for central logar province and seven others alp members

police for the province killed together with his brother and another policeman two more were wounded by a rocket fired at his car in pule alam’s shash qala area 6 read background on emarati in this aan report the name of another iskp leader reportedly killed in may 2017 hasibullah logari  see also here – he is wrongly called “abdul hasib” in these reports might also indicate that he originated from logar  the temporary iskp presence in logar also seems to have been increased by an influx of pakistani taleban later joining iskp as a result of pakistan’s antittp operations in 201415 into azra district aan reporting here in logar there was some is presence or is sympathy reported still in 2016 aan reporting here on iskp kabul cells and their connection to logar also see aan reporting here  in june 2017 naser ghairat the head of the logar provincial council pc said that uzbek and ‘chechen’ fighters had come to – largely talebancontrolled – azra district and were trying to recruit young people see a bbc pashto service report here such onesource and often unconfirmed incidents are often blown out of proportion into an alleged iskp “presence” that sounds more permanent in such areas see for example this report  this december 2018 report by west point’s combatting terrorism center p11 only lists one reported iskp attack for logar with no casualties for 201418 exact year not given in talebancontrolled azra for example even a ‘silent’ iskp presence is very unlikely given the taleban’s enmity with iskp and active participation in the fight against the group in nangrahar and kunar

your point of view they may be the harbingers of a new and better middle east—or reckless architects of disaster indeed the region’s most important relationship may be the dynamic duo of muhammad bin salman the 31yearold deputy crown prince of saudi arabia and muhammad bin zayed the 56yearold crown prince of abu dhabi the lead sheikhdom of the united arab emirates they share not only a desire to wage twin battles against iran and islamic radicalism but also a deep appreciation for their conservative gulf countries’ reliance on the united states together they have shrewdly cultivated president

appointment as deputy crown prince in 2003 and his elevation to crown prince in 2004 when his father sheikh zayed the founder of the uae died notionally his elder halfbrother khalifa is the ruler of abu dhabi and president of the uae as a whole but his health has been ravaged by successive strokes and other ailments and he is no longer seen in public mbs is tracking the same career path as his wouldbe mentor having been appointed deputy crown prince three months after his father became king in early 2015 in two short years he has amassed executive power equivalent to mbz’s—so the two men can speak as equals in terms of deciding policy and enacting it king salman clearly dotes on mbs and seems to validate almost any policy idea he puts forward the main impediment to mbs’s advance to the throne though is the saudi crown prince his 57yearold cousin muhammad bin nayef whose dour demeanor means he is sometimes described as being comatose former us officials say mbn—whose late father was the powerful hardline interior minister and later crown prince nayef bin abdulaziz a brother of the current king—is thought to be contemptuous of mbz a consequence of a 2003 wikileaked cable in which mbz is quoted as saying that nayef had a bumbling manner ‘suggesting that “darwin was right”’ widely interpreted as implying that he was like a monkey so mbz apparently regards the prospect of mbn becoming king as genetically flawed—and is cultivating his nominal deputy instead until the qatar crisis broke three weeks ago the scorecard for the mbsmbz partnership was not looking good the joint saudiuae intervention in yemen has had only qualified successes iranianbacked houthi rebels control the capital sanaa with forces loyal to the internationally recognized leader president abdrabbuh mansour hadi nowhere in sight the saudi military’s performance has been execrable – saudi pilots of apache attack helicopters don’t like to put themselves in line of sight of their targets considerably reducing their effectiveness and saudi f15 pilots drop their bombs with apparent disregard for the targets leading to excessive civilian casualties meanwhile the houthi fighters have held their own despite heavy losses widespread famine is an imminent prospect though riyadh hopes this will be blamed on the houthis rather than themselves the uae’s performance in southern yemen has been better but at a cost emirati casualties have become a domestic issue – mbz visits grieving families and the injured in the hospital and inconveniently military progress has empowered local alqaeda forces in early may a correspondent for the london times ironically on a trip to aden facilitated by the uae reported “troops loyal to president hadi…managed to push the houthis out of the southern coastal areas around aden with the support of emirati special forces and controversially fighters allied to alqaeda” the economist’s reporter travelling with him noted the rivalry between president hadi and the governor of aden who complained that hadi was recruiting alqaeda fighters both the saudis and emiratis are exasperated with hadi who is confined to virtual house arrest in riyadh the two princes also diverge somewhat when it comes to qatar mbz seems fixated on doha’s sympathy toward elements of the muslim brotherhood – particularly the support given to the shortlived morsi administration in egypt abu dhabi sees local elements of the brotherhood as being treasonous there have been arrests trials and heavy sentences mbs’s focus is said to be more on iran which he regards as a destabilizing malevolent force in the region both men are exasperated by qatar’s cautious approach to iran explicable by the two countries sharing the world’s largest offshore natural gas field and infuriated by the hostile reporting of qatari media particularly the aljazeera satellite television station abu dhabi views qatari emir tamim bin hamad al thani as a mere proxy for his father hamad who abdicated in his son’s favor in 2013 and is now titled “fatheremir” hamad who seized power from his own father in 1995 to the consternation of saudi arabia and the uae has traditionally taken a mischievous delight in almost promiscuous diplomatic flirting – israel and hamas the us and the taliban russia and antirussian islamists qatar’s penchant for such games is hard to explain but i am reminded of the occasion of a visit to doha in april 2011 when i called on a friend who was a senior al thani he laughed as he asked me whether i had seen that day’s cartoon in the london independent newspaper no i said he tapped a few times on his ipad and showed me the cartoonist’s view of the events in libya where a loose international coalition was trying to overthrow colonel muammar alqadhafi the drawing was of a fighterjet with sidebyside seating british prime minister david cameron was fighting over the controls with president nicolas sarkozy of france in the back seat with his legs up was president obama asleep a figure clearly identifiable as then qatari emir hamad was gripping the nosecone his finger in the air to see which way the wind was blowing there was no caption to the cartoon but rather a label giving the type of plane depicted the british media tends to be less straitlaced than its american counterparts the aircraft was an “fu2 infighter jet” my qatari friend said to me “that’s rude isn’t it” trying to work out the twists and turns of the qatar crisis is challenging the saudiuaeled bid to isolate qatar seems to have been precooked whether or not emir tamim really made his reported sympathetic comments about iran which qatar denies breaking off diplomatic relations and closing land borders and airspace prompt the question of what team mbsmbz is hoping to achieve washington’s position was itself muddled last week when president trump blasted qatar’s alleged ties to terrorist funding a mere 90 minutes after secretary of state rex tillerson asked the saudis and emiratis to calm down what is the us endgame many gulf analysts worry that qatar won’t capitulate and iran will reap the diplomatic rewards  apart from mbs and mbz there are probably two other key players uae ambassador to the us yousef alotaiba some of whose emails were leaked last week in what may be a subplot of the crisis and presidential senior adviser and soninlaw jared kushner otaiba with whom i have exchanged emails is very much mbz’s man and is credited with suggesting the lunch between president trump and mbs in march otaiba has also been one of the more successful ambassadors in developing contacts with kushner he orchestrated mbz’s semisecret trip to trump tower to meet presidentelect trump and kushner during the transition which has also led to a jaredmbs bonding the key elements of the riyadh summits during president trump’s visit to the middle east were apparently agreed by whatsapp messages between the two men but diplomatic excitement does not necessarily produce successful outcomes mbs shrugged off the title of being the architect of the yemen military adventure when it became clear that victory was not going to come easily low oil prices are hampering his vision 2030 plan for economic transformation in the kingdom subsidy cuts which were causing economic pain for ordinary saudis may well have been reversed recently against mbs’s wishes the wider house of saud may have appreciated the deleterious impact rather better than mbs whose recent purchase of a 500 million superyacht may yet prove a political embarrassment so is the mbsmbz campaign against qatar going to be a quick success or require an embarrassing climbdown emir tamim and his wily father know how to change positions as pressures demand as this crisis continues the future potential roles of mbs and mbz either individually or together in the middle east will become clearer success could mean blunted ambitions for iran and a defeated islamic state but overconfidence is not a prescription for victory cooler heads in riyadh abu dhabi and washington should be listened to getting it wrong could have dreadful consequences for the region as well as the wider world  california   by jeremy b white   updated 050820 0944 pm edt   by sam sutton and carly sitrin    by bill mahoney and josh gerstein   updated 032920 0248 pm edt    ©

67,there has rarely been a worsekept secret only hours after returning from another clandestine meeting with saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu instructed his aides to “leak” the news to the israeli media  the israeli censor the official body which usually forbids israeli reports on relations with countries with whom israel doesn’t have official diplomatic relations was silent it was widely understood as a signal to allow the information to be published   and the news published was thus netanyahu  accompanied by his military attache brigadier general avi bluth mossad chief yossi cohen and national security adviser meir ben shabat  flew on sunday night in a private jet chartered from israeli businessman udi angel to the futuristic city of neom a saudi red sea resort there they met for three hours with bin salman and khalid bin ali alhumaidan the directorgeneral of the gulf kingdom’s general intelligence directorate the meeting was facilitated by outgoing us secretary of state mike pompeo who was also present israeli prime ministers and all heads of mossad since shabtai shavit in the early 1990s have occasionally met with senior saudi officials including intelligence chiefs and military generals however all these past meetings had been tightly kept secrets with the saudis insisting and warning their israeli interlocutors against revealing they had taken place except for some incidental leaks to foreign media the arrangement was honoured by both sides and secrecy was maintained bearing in mind the nature of past encounters it is clear that the involved parties always knew how to make sure that the beans were not spilled therefore the exposure of the most recent meeting seems to indicate that bin salman likely approved in advance and coordinated with netanyahu so that reports about the “secret” meeting wouldn’t come out through official statements but rather as an authorised leak which can still leave room for deniability  in other words the meeting and the readiness to make it semiofficial in the blink of an eye is yet another step taken by saudi arabia to normalise its relations with israel it comes on the heels of a long list of moves and gestures towards israel over the years including past clandestine meetings the purchase of israeli hightech equipment and cyber technology enabling the saudi government to spy on its dissidents close exchanges of views and intelligence assessment on iran’s regional intentions and nuclear capabilities permission for israeli jets to fly over saudi territory and the greenlight for israeli citizens with dual nationality to visit the kingdom for business tourist purposes and more nevertheless the nocturnal meeting on sunday night two months before us president donald trump leaves the white house didn’t produce the ultimately desired results pompeo and netanyahu reportedly pushed the crown prince to come out in the open and make much more significant and symbolic gestures in the direction of israel they tried to persuade him to agree to a public meeting or a joint statement they explained to him that when joe biden becomes the 46th us president it will be more difficult to promote bilateral relations between israel and saudi arabia because any move would likely be conditioned on being part of a larger deal that would include the palestinians  but bin salman was not persuaded it’s not that he cares about the fate of the palestinians  he doesn’t in a rare public opinion poll conducted in august by the proisrael washington institute saudis were asked to pick their first choice from four possible priorities for american policy in the region only 23 percent chose “pushing for a twostate solution to the palestinianisraeli conflict” the majority opted for other choices to contain iran end wars in yemen and libya and defend the syrian people  but bin salman fears that moving too fast to officialise relations with israel may backfire especially domestically many saudis including among the clergy and conservatives perceive israel as a hated enemy  another important factor contributing to the hesitations of the crown prince to legitimise his relations with israel is his father israeli and american intelligence sources familiar with the thinking in the royal house of saud told middle east eye that as long as 85yearold king salman is alive he will continue to support the palestinian cause and restrain his capricious son the king like his predecessors supports a twostate solution in which israel and palestine live side by side in peace the ruler and his son are also waiting anxiously to see what decisions the biden administration will take on the iranian front more than anything else saudi leaders are concerned that the incoming us leader who intends to open talks with iran will lift sanctions and sign a new nuclear deal favourable to tehran thus mohammed bin salman is at the moment torn between his disregard for the palestinian cause his desire and need to use israel to prevent cooperation between biden and iran and his father and the conservative circles who want to see a just solution to the israelipalestinian conflict the delicate situation with conflicting domestic and international interests forces the crown prince to continue sitting on the fence and avoid taking dramatic decisions it is expected that saudi arabia will continue with its step by step policy of cautiously enhancing relations with israel  view the discussion thread  © middle east eye 2020  all

123,the taliban is a sunni islamist nationalist and propashtun movement founded in the early 1990s that ruled most of afghanistan from 1996 until october 2001 the movement’s founding nucleusâthe   word “taliban” is pashto for “students”âwas composed of peasant farmers   and men studying islam in afghan and pakistani madrasas or religious   schools the taliban found a foothold and consolidated their strength in   southern afghanistan by 1994 the taliban had moved their way through the south   capturing several provinces from various armed factions who had been   fighting a civil war after the sovietbacked afghan government fell in 1992 by september 1996 the taliban had captured kabul killed the country’s president and established the islamic emirate of afghanistan the taliban’s first move was to institute a strict interpretation of qur‘anic   instruction and jurisprudence in practice this meant often merciless   policies on the treatment of women political opponents of any type and   religious minorities in the years leading up to the 11 september 2001 attacks in the united states the taliban provided a safe haven for alqa‘ida this gave alqa‘ida   a base in which it could freely recruit train and deploy terrorists   to other countries the taliban held sway in afghanistan until october   2001 when they were routed from power by the usled campaign against alqa‘ida  in arguably the most significant development in the afghanistanpakistan region since the may 2011 death of alqa‘ida   founder usama bin ladin the taliban in july 2015 revealed that its   reclusive leader mullah mohammed omar had died in 2013 omar who was   the president of afghanistan during the taliban’s rule and a   major bin ladin supporter was wanted by the us government through the   rewards for justice program mullah akhtar mohammed mansur who was omar’s secondincommand in early august 2015 was selected as the new taliban leader mansur is only the second leader that the group has ever had  the afghan taliban are responsible for most insurgent attacks in afghanistan which follow an established pattern of regular lowlevel ambush and hitandrun attacks coupled with periodic highprofile   attacks the taliban have been moving aggressively in many parts of the   country evidenced by the fact that suicide and complex attacks   increased by 78 percent countrywide in the first six months of 2015   compared with the same period in 2014 the taliban between 7 and 10   august 2015 conducted a series of attacks in quick succession in kabul   that resulted in at least 60 deaths marking the deadliest stretch in   the capital since the usled invasion in 2001 in the first   attack a suicide bomber detonated a large truck bomb in a residential   area while attempting to target an afghan defense ministry building   killing 15 civilians and wounding up to 400 others on its own the   explosion caused an unprecedented number of casualties from a single   attack in the capital in recent yearsâthe taliban is widely   suspected of having conducted the attack although they did not claim   responsibility for it because of the massive civilian casualties less   than 24 hours later over 40 cadets and civilians were killed when a   suicide bomber dressed in police uniform blew himself up at the entrance   of kabul police academy later that day a taliban squad targeted   resolute support mission installation camp integrity killing at least   nine including one nato serviceman on 10 august a taliban suicide   bomber plowed a car into a checkpoint near the entrance to kabul   international airport killing at least 5 and wounding 15                                 national counterterrorism center note documents in portable document format pdf require adobe acrobat reader 50

61,by george barros november 16 2020 the kremlin will likely cite russia’s “peacekeeping mission” in nagorno karabakh in its 2021 bid to legitimize the collective security treaty organization csto as a united nations unrecognized peacekeeping force the csto stated it plans to conduct negotiations with the un in 2021 to hold csto peacekeeping operations under the un’s auspices1 this stated effort aligns with the kremlin’s assessed campaign to leverage the un to justify russia’s international military deployments—an important hybrid war capability the kremlin is developing2 the kremlin is likely leveraging the csto to manage perceptions about russia’s military deployment to nagorno karabakh the kremlin deployed 1960 russian “peacekeepers” to nagorno karabakh on november 103 these russian personnel are unspecified elements of the roshchinskybased 15th separate motor rifle brigade unspecified elements of the ulyanovskbased 31st airborne assault brigade and unspecified elements of the kubinabased separate 45th guards spetsnaz detached brigade—a special operations unit of the russian airborne forces vdv4 this “peacekeeping” mission is an exclusively russian undertaking and does not include any csto personnel structures or frameworks as of this writing the csto nonetheless is supporting this russian military deployment in the international information space5 csto secretary general stanislav zas said that russia’s peacekeeping mission helped established peace in nagorno karabakh on november 116 the csto’s favorable coverage of an exclusively russian operation may seek to create a larger false impression that the csto is somehow involved in this operation the successful creation of this impression will lend the operation additional connotations of legitimacy through perceived csto backing or could support a new formal csto involvement in the operation russian president vladimir putin likely seeks to blur the lines between russian and csto activities as part of a hybrid warfare technique to obfuscate russian activities russian president vladimir putin likely seeks to create an impression linking russian “peacekeepers” in nagorno karabakh to “humanitarian assistance” the russian defense ministry began constructing an “interdepartmental center for humanitarian response” in nagorno karabakh’s capital of stepanakert on november 15 2020 as part of its operation in that region7 the kremlin claims this center will coordinate russianled refugee resettlement and humanitarian efforts8 this effort helps the kremlin frame its military personnel deployed abroad as legitimate humanitarian actors the kremlin is intensifying efforts to brand csto peacekeepers as a legitimate humanitarian force the csto announced plans to add a special medical unit to the csto’s peacekeeping force on november 12 and called to build further capability to counter covid19 on november 139 the kremlin will likely leverage the addition of a mostly symbolic csto medical detachment to assist its framing of csto peacekeepers as a humanitarian force the kremlin previously included csto personnel and international committee of the red cross observers in the october 2020 unbreakable brotherhood exercises in belarus to frame russian deployments to belarus as legitimate and internationally accepted despite putin’s intensified efforts to undermine belarus’s sovereignty10 putin will likely increase russian control over csto member states’ militaries on november 17 the csto will hold a security council secretariat committee meeting on november 17 to further formalize agreements on csto peacekeeping equipping its rapid reaction force rrf coalition security militarytechnical cooperation and counternarcotic efforts11 csto member states will likely sign two plans one on joint training for command and control structures and joint military forces and another on cooperation on foreign policy through the end of 2020 and the first half of 202112 this will advance putin’s larger campaign to subordinate former soviet union fsu states’ militaries to russiandominated structures the csto rrf conducted a rapid response exercise in medvezhi ozera moscow oblast november 1112 that could support a russian military deployment to belarus13 this exercise tested the rrf’s capabilities by using vdv signals elements as the csto’s command and control backbone for the first time an unspecified number of russian belarusian kazakh kyrgyz and tajik personnel participated in the exercise at the base of the 38th separate signals regiment—the vdv’s only separate signals regiment14 the russian ministry of defense did not state how many personnel participated in this exercise or provide the comprehensive readout that usually accompanies such exercises the kremlin likely seeks to increase the rrf’s effectiveness by leveraging the vdv’s expeditionary capabilities15 the kremlin may deploy csto “peacekeepers” to belarus using the csto rrf selfdeclared belarusian president alexander lukashenko gave an interview on november 13 in which he praised deeper integration with russia via the csto as the “main remedy” for color revolutions16 the kremlin may brand a potential future conventional russian military deployment to belarus as a csto multinational “peacekeeping” mission to conceal putin’s intent to use such a deployment to further integrate belarus into russia csto member states will likely begin developing information technology it under a kremlincontrolled unified security framework csto member states agreed on the necessity to develop “uniform it rules between states” to ensure collective security on november 1217 csto member states reportedly are developing a fiveyear plan to harmonize legislation on it regulations including the creation of a single digital signature among csto states18 this effort to control csto states’ it regulations on the kremlin’s terms advances several larger kremlin campaigns including the kremlin’s campaign to contest the west in international information and communications technologies—a campaign the kremlin launched in 201419 this effort if successful will likely increase russian access to csto members’ it technical networks increasing russia’s cyber capabilities20 the united states and nato should take several steps to mitigate these threats the west should closely monitor russianled “peacekeeping missions” to challenge putin’s assertions that these operations are humanitarian in nature when they could in fact support hybrid wars the west should call out russian efforts to undermine fsu states’ sovereignty by subordinating their militaries and it industries to russiandominated structures the west should also call out russian efforts to manipulate the information space by characterizing its hybrid operations as “peacekeeping missions” western leaders should pressure the un not to recognize the csto as a legitimate peacekeeping force

189,those ‘living the war’ in afghanistan both civilians and combatants have had markedly different experiences in the last seven months depending on where they are in the country those in talebancontrolled areas have seen unexpected peace since the united states and taleban signed their agreement in doha after the us largely halted air attacks and the afghan government moved to a defensive posture for others even as the taleban have shifted away from major attacks evidence from the ground points to them intensifying other forms of violence and to rising civilian casualties he encounters jubilant taleban and demoralised members of the ansf in compelling reportage from three provinces andrew quilty explores the changing patterns of violence he also asks what the view from the ground can tell us about the prospects for violence in afghanistan to be reduced – a demand from kabul but so far refused by the taleban  a policeman walks around a tunnel dug beneath a bedroom in an ansf outpost in joy begum village a few kilometres east of the imam saheb district centre in kunduz province in an area where dozens of ansf have been killed in fighting with the taliban in recent weeks photo andrew quilty this is the fifth report published by aan to understand the conflict since the eightdays of reduction in violence riv 2129 february which marked the ustaleban agreement 1 it is based on 53 interviews with taleban four members of the afghan national security forces ansf 18 government officials six and other civilians 26 the interviews were conducted between june and august with travel to three provinces maidan wardak kunduz and nangrahar to assess how the changes in the military stance of the parties to the conflict since the doha agreement have affected civilians and combatants  highlights of the report   taleban and us forces came away from the doha talks in february with very different interpretations of how violence would be reduced overall   us airstrikes and ansf attacks including night raids are mostly down but while the taleban have largely stopped attacking “major military centres” they have increased other forms of attacks  for civilians living deep in areas of taleban control living without the threat of air strikes large scale ground operations or night raids life has taken on a normality many have not known for years in areas under government control aside from the decreased likelihood of being caught up in largescale terrorist attacks the risk is much the same as it was prior to the signing of the doha agreement  for people living in contested areas the defensive posture of the ansf means taleban attacks against ansf positions have become more frequent as are indiscriminate responses by the ansf the risk for civilians of being caught in the crossfire has increased taleban morale is high with the threat of attack by government or us forces reduced many feel the prospect of victory is closer than ever—whether by political or military means  many members of the ansf express frustration with the government’s passivity towards the taleban and see the doha agreement as having been made in bad faith  taleban are putting pressure on the ansf to defect increased presence of foreign fighters apparently using the lull in airstrikes to provide training in maidan wardak the cessation of night raids and airstrikes that characterised 2018 and 2019 has brought calm to areas under taleban control in contested areas the taleban have become emboldened to strike at a static ansf and because the areas the government control are so small increasing violence on the fringes often impacts the government areas in kunduz the taleban have a stronger presence on all roads to and from the capital than at any other time since 2001 afghan national police anp and afghan local police alp in frontline outposts are under pressure and frustrated that the afghan national army ana is not more proactive circumstances have changed less in nangrahar where the violence has been mostly confined to areas that were active prior to the signing of the doha agreement however a large influx of foreign fighters into the southwestern districts is of concern no reduction in violence broken promises – or selective interpretation – of the doha agreement     after us and taleban representatives forged their agreement to bring peace to afghanistan on 29 february the us claimed on twitter that the parties “spoke of all sides reducing violence by as much as 80 percent to pave the way for intraafghan peace talks” part of the doha agreement is said to have been contained in secret annexes and anyway verbally agreed upon which apparently stipulated that us forces and the taleban would halt offensive operations against one another immediately for the us that included halting the use of offensive air power while reserving the right to defend afghan government forces under serious threat president ashraf ghani ordered the afghan national security forces ansf into a defensive footing too afghan forces appear to have largely—but not entirely—suspended offensive operations   the taleban on the other hand went back on the offensive immediately on 2 march taleban spokesman zabihullah mujahed told reuters they were prepared to resume military operations against afghan forces at any moment “it could be any time it could be after an hour tonight tomorrow or the day after” the following day according to the ministry of interior taleban attacks were reported in 17 provinces see aan reporting on the first month after doha here   the us and afghan governments acknowledge a decrease in largescale taleban attacks in provincial capitals but continue to bemoan what they perceive as the group’s breach of a commitment to reduce violence the taleban have denied that such an agreement was ever made stating on the group’s website on 5 april that “according to the signed agreements until the intraafghan negotiations lead to a separate agreement with the afghan sides and reach a comprehensive ceasefire the islamic emirate can attack kabul administration all military centres whether in rural areas or in urban areas” suggesting they have in fact gone beyond the commitments that were agreed upon the statement continued “the islamic emirate neither has attacked their centres in major cities nor had carried out operations at major military centres” two days later in response to continued taleban aggression on 7 april the ansf moved from a defensive to an ‘active defensive’ stance   it may be that this is a case of both sides leaving with a different understanding of what had been agreed – a kind of cognitive bias that often bedevils negotiations assuming that both sides are genuine in their divergent accounts 2 it does appear that the taleban may largely be sticking to their narrow interpretation of the agreement which they have insisted is voluntary and not per any agreement with the us which is to refrain from attacking “centres in major cities” or “major military centres” aside from a handful of incidents including a truck bomb near a court in gardez and a humvee bomb targeting ghazni’s national directorate of security nds headquarters both on 14 may a car bomb attack against an nds office in samangan’s capital aybak on 13 july and a roadside bomb targeting vice president amrullah saleh on 9 september which killed ten bystanders largescale bombings and complex attacks claimed by the taleban in afghan cities have fallen markedly since doha   on the other hand if there was a general agreement to reduce overall levels of violence as the americans claim then this is being clearly contravened by a sharp rise in the incidence of smaller attacks and targeted assassinations government officials and security personnel as well as human rights advocates and religious figures have been killed and injured in what appears to be a carefully calibrated campaign of violence using magnetic ieds suicide bombers and small teams of gunmen in kabul and provincial and district centres on 4 october the afghan independent human rights commission released findings from an investigation into  targeted killing of civilians aihrc stated that 533 were killed and 412 injured in assassination attempts in the previous six months but as aan has reported previously there are fewer claims of responsibility from the taleban for such attacks small to mediumsized coordinated attacks against ansf outposts and checkpoints have continued at a steady pace while the use of improvised explosive devices ieds targeting ansf vehicles and convoys particularly on highways appears to have risen in some areas  when attacks on a maternity hospital in kabul and a funeral procession in nangrahar caused dozens of deaths on 12 may despite the taleban’s disavowal of both president ghani announced a resumption of offensive operations against the insurgents the announcement however according to numerous ansf personnel who spoke with aan in three provinces does not appear to have led to any real change in the government’s actual posture on the battlefield   casualty figures since the signing of the doha agreement do not reflect the drop in violence that afghan and us officials had hoped would precede intraafghan talks it should be noted that the anticipated period between those two occasions expanded from less than two weeks to more than six months unama’s most recent report on civilian casualties reported 3458 dead and wounded civilians in the first six months of 2020 a 13 percent drop compared to the same period last year but noted the decline was mainly due to the cessation of antitaleban international military operations and the declining capabilities of the islamic state khorasan province iskp javid faisal then spokesperson for the national security council tweeted on 22 june that “the past week was the deadliest of the past 19 years taleban carried out 422 attacks in 32 provinces martyring 291 andsf members and wounding 550 others” faisal declined to provide aan with more recent figures while in an opinion piece published by the washington post on 14 august president ghani wrote that according to government figures 12279 afghan security forces and civilians had been killed or wounded by the taleban since february 29 the taleban do not publish their own casualty figures  government forces have not been without fault either despite their defensive posture they have nevertheless been responsible for numerous civilian deaths and injuries caused by excessive force or insufficient precaution when retaliating to taleban aggression in the most welldocumented incident 19 civilians were killed and 31 were injured in a crowded bazaar in sangin helmand on 27 june when ana soldiers responded to a taleban mortar attack with mortars of their own while this was the most deadly incident it is by no means an isolated one aan spoke with numerous civilians who said that since doha government forces have regularly responded to taleban attacks on their bases and outposts with indiscriminate mortar and artillery fire without regard for civilians or their property  outside kabul and provincial capitals in areas where local populations are accustomed to living through prolonged military campaigns under the buzz of drones and the fear of night raids the change in posture on both sides of the conflict since 29 february has resulted in new realities for local populations and combatants alike for some the change has brought welcome relief while for others their experience of the conflict has become even more acute in the following section we report on findings from aan visits to maidan wardak kunduz and nangrahar   maidan wardak  maidan wardak has seen the greatest reversal of battlefield momentum of the three provinces visited by aan in contrast with 2018 and 2019 which were marked by an intense offensive period since the doha agreement the afghan security forces have been quiet while the taleban have taken advantage of the absence of airstrikes and nds raids they have carried out more attacks on ansf checkpoints and are exerting greater control of the roads    map 1 wardak province increased taleban attacks on checkpoints and bases since june   in the months immediately after the doha agreement was signed fighting in wardak dropped significantly aside from a spike in attacks against ansf posts during ramadan when a few anp checkpoints were overrun violence has remained low taleban attacks then ramped up significantly in late june with violence continuing to escalate since then the government forces are scared  one local taleban commander obaidullah who commands around 25 men around shaikhabad in sayedabad district said that with no air strikes or night raids to contend with “we have more freedom now previously we’d attack and then withdraw quickly but now we don’t have those fears” he said that meant they could sustain attacks for longer  an ana lieutenant based in sayedabad confirmed that government forces had moved to a defensive posture locally he told aan that the 1st and 2nd kandaks of the 5th brigade 203 corps based in dashte top had not been doing offensive operations since the doha agreement was signed operations aimed at improving security along the highway in wardak have been conducted but they are small in scale he said and are more counteroffensive than offensive  taleban control of the roads   greater taleban control of major roads a postdoha taleban trend countrywide has also been seen in wardak the shift has been made possible by the defensive posture of the ansf and the lack of us air strikes so to that extent it has been opportunistic although control of major roads has always been a priority for both sides   ansf members in wardak spoke about this to aan haji lal muhammad deputy commander of an anp checkpoint beside highway 1 on the southern edge of government control in maidanshahr said that with the threat of air strikes gone the taleban had become emboldened previously taleban checkpoints on the highway south of maidanshahr were relatively common but never longlasting while travelling recently from kandahar to maidan wardak by bus lal muhammad said they passed through eight taleban checkpoints during the nighttime journey “they aren’t stressed about air strikes anymore” he said without letting on how he had passed through safely he continued “they walk around in the open with their weapons… they are very relaxed checking everyone slowly and carefully”    in late july humayun a policeman under lal muhammad at the highway checkpoint pointed to a bend in the road south of their position “no one has been able to move past this corner after dark in the last 15 days” on 20 july a large convoy of ana had stopped on the highway in sayedabad when a vehicle laden with explosives drove alongside it and other vehicles and was detonated according to one security source 39 soldiers were killed and as many as 25 vehicles destroyed although media reports citing ministry of defence officials suggested only eight or nine soldiers were killed with a further nine wounded   nasim who is from sayedabad but lives in kabul told aan that during one recent visit to shaikhabad drivers in an ansf convoy had staggered their vehicles throughout civilian traffic on the highway so that taleban fighters would not attack “the taleban won’t fire on them” he said “because if civilians are killed the government will use it as propaganda”  increased ied attacks  greater freedom of movement for the taleban has also seen a significant rise in the their use of ieds against ansf convoys on the kabul to kandahar highway between the southern edge of maidanshahr and dashte top a distance of 30 kilometres aan counted 19 ied craters in the highway in early september that had yet to be filled in interspersed with several other olderlooking craters that had also yet to be repaired some of the 19 craters were still ringed by mounds of bitumen and roadbase not yet compacted by passing traffic perhaps indicating that they were created relatively recently   colonel hamidullah kohdamani commander of the ana’s 5th brigade 203rd ‘thunder’ corps which oversees wardak said in sayedabad in early september that his men diffuse between five and ten ieds on the 95 kilometre stretch of the kabul to kandahar highway that runs through the province every day “it’s a big problem often we come under attack while diffusing them”  one of kohdamani’s subordinates however said that previously routine minesweeping operations on the highway were uncommon nowadays and that the increase in ied attacks against government security forces was damaging morale “we know that if we find a mine they will plant another there the following night” as if the soldiers needed to be reminded a crumpled tangle of paintedgreen steel—the remains of an armoured humvee—lay on top of an ana flatbed truck in the 5th battalion headquarters in dashte top three days after it was struck by an ied on the highway close to the base one occupant was killed and four others were so seriously injured they had to be airlifted out by an ana medevac helicopter  2nd lieutenant omaidullah commands an anp highway patrol unit responsible for a stretch of highway south of maidanshahr he had served with police special forces until a combat injury forced him to transfer to a less demanding unit from a hilltop satellite outpost overlooking haji lal muhammad’s highway checkpoint on 24 august he pointed to a stretch on the highway around a kilometre south past the bend which policeman humayun had said was virtually impassable after dark ten days before he said the humvee he was travelling in during a night patrol had been struck by an ied “i thought my body was separated from my legs at first” he said but was otherwise unfussed by the explosion that tore the front of his armoured vehicle away from the cabin leaving its occupants injured but alive and bored a deep conicalshaped crater as tall as him in the highway he was still limping from what was his sixth combat injury  two nights after omaidullah told the story of his lucky escape friends of his from an afghan national civil order police unit manning a checkpoint on the southern side of a bridge pule sorkh a couple of kilometres south of where his humvee was struck were ambushed early in the morning “they used heavy weapons – 82s an antitank recoilless rifle and sniper rifles” he said “and fought from 3am until dawn” only losing one man in the attack was as good as a victory for omaidullah “i will kiss the hands of my men when i see them”  highwayside government checkpoints too have come under greater pressure since june between aan’s visits in june and july humayun from the checkpoint just south of maidanshahr said several checkpoints had been captured by the taleban “now we can’t even walk around the base” he said crouched below a sandbagged parapet overlooking the dehe afghanan residential area adjacent to the ‘green zone’ south of the provincial capital he pointed to a pile of river stones a monument for a fellow policeman azim who was shot and killed as he walked past a gap in the base’s concrete blastwalls by a sniper the day before “the taleban are just past the first row of houses” he said pointing through the sandbags “for the last few days” he said “people have been saying they might try to capture our checkpoint at night they’re able to surround us”  ansf members talk about how the taleban have been funnelling in from the southwest attacking outposts within a kilometre of the governor’s office in one attack on 23 august five men were killed in a dehe afghanan outpost close to where the green zone ends at maidanshahr the anp at the highway checkpoint south of the provincial capital have a view across the valley and saw it happen in fact they had seen the taleban’s steady infiltration of the green zone from the southwest over the weeks before as attacks edged closer and closer to the city with such momentum the police thought an attack on the governor’s compound in the coming weeks was plausible   in fact the taleban has even been conducting regular attacks on government checkpoints and outposts between maidanshahr and kabul in recent months in the arghandi area where traffic on the highway slows at the gate that marks the border between the two provinces aan witnessed fighting within a few hundred metres of the highway while returning from maidanshahr twice in august it was on the same stretch of highway that the armoured vehicle carrying maidanshahr’s mayor zarifa ghafari was targeted but unharmed by gunmen on 3 october this year but an attack on a provincial capital itself seems outside the taleban’s current modus operandi   a senior taleban military commander who spoke to aan described their current posture as ‘on standby’ — maintaining a low level of military offensives in order that gains of the past several years are not forfeited while abstaining from large scale attacks in cities or attempts to capture them entirely “we haven’t launched big military operations in my areas we’ve taken some checkpoints” he said “but not district centres” this he said keeps them within the bounds of what was agreed in doha they are he said “fighting everywhere everyday but our big operations have stopped for now… we are sticking to our side of the agreement – it is important that we keep our word”   more foreign fighters   another change in some talebancontrolled areas in wardak is an increase in the presence of foreign fighters the two lowlevel taleban commanders aan spoke to from sayedabad and daymirdad said that since doha the numbers of foreign fighters had increased most they say are waziris or urdu speakers or others with nonnative heavilyaccented pashto so probably pakistanis who had been present in wardak in the past but have been seen in more significant numbers of late these fighters have had controlled access routes between wardak and the durand line through logar then either on through nangrahar or paktia for years “locals don’t like having these people here” said keramatullah a lowlevel taleban commander from daymirdad “nor do the local taleban authorities but it’s something that’s not in our control” keramatullah and obaidullah both from sayedabad said the “foreign fighters” took part in the smallscale attacks that were being carried out but little else was known about them “we aren’t allowed to get close to them” said keramatullah “they’re under direct command of the taleban governor but we don’t know where they stay” often he said they will appear in times of fighting and then disappear once an operation is over  the more senior taleban commander interviewed by aan dismissed the notion of them being foreign fighters “they are from the other side of the durand line they’re afghans” otherwise he said people are mistaking fighters from the taleban’s red unit or their subsidiary ‘laser’ units as foreigners because they are necessarily aloof the red unit – the taleban’s’ special forces equivalent – he said are forbidden from speaking to people outside their units and always wear face coverings “chechens tajiks arabs they’re not in our areas”  decreased nds raids and air strikes   for both residents and combatants alike 2018 and 2019 will be remembered for the brutal campaign of night raids—mostly carried out by the nds01 unit—and air strikes by both afghan and us forces with the vast majority of the province’s territory under the control of the taleban since at least 2018 few wardak residents except those in the two northern behsud districts in the talebanhostile hazarajat 3 were spared at least indirect experience of the raids according to residents and security analysts the raids ceased almost entirely around the time the doha agreement was signed this was also the case in nangrahar and other eastern provinces that had seen a high frequency of raids by other nds special force units over the same period   away from the frontlines in talebancontrolled areas the end of the raids and air strikes has brought positive change to the quality of life for many wardakis farwad a 21yearold resident of daymirdad district said that “since the doha agreement in wardak there’s no bombardments or night raids the people are very happy – it’s like the time of eid”   during a visit to sayedabad’s tangi valley which the taleban have controlled since before 2014 but which bore the brunt of numerous night raids and associated air strikes last year aan witnessed a sense of calm that does not exist in contested areas nor wardak’s governmentheld provincial capital   several farmers from different districts who spoke to aan in 2019 said they were often unable to work their fields — especially at night in summer and during ramadan — because of the risk posed by raids and air strikes according to world bank data more than 80 per cent of wardak households derive income from agriculture or livestock but ahmad shah a farmer from nerkh said  now people can water their land at any time of day or night because there are no security issues previously if someone was outside and a drone came they couldn’t move or return home or anything wardakis are no longer living like prisoners in their homes  civilians caught in the crossfire on the new frontlines     in contrast for those living close to frontlines their lives have become even more fraught particularly for those near main roads or the islandlike governmentheld district centres and even the provincial capital maidanshahr since doha it is the farmers in these areas who are unable to tend their crops adam khan lives in lalakhel on the southern outskirts of maidanshahr he said that the police at checkpoints on the government frontline regularly fire toward the invisible taleban line of control near his house in an effort to keep them at bay “they’re trying to scare the taleban” he told aan in late july “but the taleban don’t pay any attention to civilians so they don’t care” when they’re patrolling on the road he said of the police “they’re firing the whole time and if the taleban fire one bullet the police will fire 500 this is only in the last six months” as a result people like adam khan now find themselves in the same position as farmers who last year were fearing drones and night raids in taleban areas last year now he is unable to work except he said very early in the morning “after this time” he said “it is very lucky if you’re able to do your farming”   hehmatullah and hezbollah were injured when a munition fired from a nearby anp base exploded as they were playing near their home in kodai village chak district as their father watered his land photo andrew quilty nurullah a 38yearold farmer from kodai in chak district said he was watering his land about a kilometre from an afghan national police anp base around dusk on 25 july recounting the evening to aan he said his two sons and a nephew were playing nearby according to nurullah there was no fighting in the vicinity at the time out of nowhere a small explosive munition landed close by and sprayed the three boys with shrapnel when aan visited the hospital the next day all three were recovering from surgery to remove fragments from their stomachs in the provincial hospital in maidanshahr “it came from the police base” said nurullah “my house was struck by government mortars and damaged” since the doha agreement he said these dynamics have become pronounced “the national police have changed their behaviour” he said “because they’re stuck in their bases they fire a lot from them”  ehsanullah 32 also from chak was at the hospital that day as well he complained of the ana firing artillery at night “when it’s dark they are afraid and firing mortars and artillery without targets or coordinates” it is experiences like nurullah’s that continue to push the people of wardak further from the government “we don’t have any problem with the taleban” said ehsanullah “all our problems come from the government”   taleban recruitment   there are new pressures from the taleban to contend with however dr esmatullah asim was head of the provincial hospital before recently being elected to the provincial council asim agrees about the population’s disaffection from the government though he said it is a longstanding problem which helped to fuel the insurgency in its infancy after 2006 “people are graduating from university and there are no jobs they are jobless and looking for people to hear their problems” now without the military pressure of previous years he said the taleban are capitalising on the growing distance between the government and wardakis “they are very accessible for young people” he said that in part is due to the relatively captive nature of their constituency this also translates into recruiting said asim which the taleban have used the postdoha detente to focus on   a senior taleban military commander who asked not to be named concurred but said that recruitment efforts were aimed at turning members of the ansf more than getting new noncombatants to join up the reason for the heightened activity of the recruitment commission he said is at least in part due to the change in the makeup of their enemy’s ranks in response to a question about whether or not their ‘jihad’ was still legitimate now that they were no longer fighting foreigners he said “you’re right about jihad being against the us not afghans that’s why we’re giving ansf a chance to surrender before attacking them” before operations he said the recruitment commission now sends messages to those at the target location urging the ansf members to defect rather than resist “we’re trying to convince them that they’re defending corrupt people”   social restrictions relaxed and phone coverage restored  a senior member of staff in wardak in one international health ngo said his work in talebancontrolled areas has changed for the better since doha previously he said “the taleban were very aggressive but since doha they are acting like a government not as an antigovernment force… i think they want to prove that they can provide governance” moreover he said “they are much more relaxed with the people” the ngo worker’s sentiments reinforced aan’s sense that the decreased military pressure on the taleban in wardak had benefited civilians living under their control   the ngo worker explained that coordination between the taleban’s district and provincial health commissions and the military commission has also benefitted from the drop in violence “there are no challenges for us in taleban areas but in the government areas we are stopped and searched and questioned all the time since doha”  prior to the doha agreement taleban suspicion about local informants was rife with civilians often suffering depredations like limits on mobile services and even on the use of mobile phone cameras in 2018 and 2019 the taleban controlled mobile phone towers across most of wardak and enforced a restriction on phone use to a few hours early each morning the aim was to hamper any informants helping the afghan and us military according to residents and a local engineer the phone towers are now mostly on both day and night   kunduz  the taleban’s strength in kunduz since the departure of german forces in october 2013 is welldocumented most famously illustrated by the group’s brief capture of kunduz city in 2015 and again 2016 aan reporting here and here no other provincial capital has come under such sustained pressure from all sides even wardak—where the government has arguably less control over its districts—does not feel as constricted as kunduz city where the taleban continue to infiltrate the outskirts    map 2 kunduz province beyond kunduz city the taleban have been mostly in control of the district centres of chahar dara dashte archi and qalaye zal for several years the latter was physically moved in 2018 to enable the government to retain its claim of control there more recently khanabad to the east aliabad to the southwest and imam saheb to the north have all come under sustained taleban pressure the province’s three new subdistricts of gor tepa also known as gul tepa aqtash and kulbad are all largely under taleban sway since the doha agreement was signed taleban pressure on the government has only intensified travellers wanting to use the highways to khanabad and aliabad have found it virtually impossible to avoid encountering taleban fighters carrying weapons in the open or stopping motorists at checkpoints this is especially the case at night meanwhile imam saheb on the border with tajikistan is the focus of a new taleban front threatening the eastern fringe of the district’s populated agricultural zone with dozens of border forces alp and anp dying in recent months  increased taleban assaults and ansf frustration   for the anp stationed at kunduz city’s northern gate fighting is an almost daily occurrence on a visit to the city in july aan met faizullah a 45yearold policeman “since the peace process began” he said referring to the 29 february doha agreement “we are only defending the taleban attacked us here last night… sometimes they’re coming from all sides and surrounding us”  on the opposite side of the city dastagir commands the checkpoint that leads south into aliabad district and beyond to baghlan province and kabul the checkpoint which is only a kilometre from the ana’s large battalion headquarters beside kunduz’s airstrip on a raised plateau has only come under attack a handful of times since he took command nine months ago the smaller alp and ana satellite outposts to the south and even those a few minutes’ drive north however have been less fortunate “it is worse now than it was” he said “the taleban are taking advantage because we are only defending” what has changed he said is that now the taleban are “sure the us won’t attack or make aerial bombardments the taleban have captured some areas they cut blocked the highway… they have had many achievements since doha all around kunduz they have come closer to the city”  the checkpoint sits under an archway and is manned by a single policeman most of the day because attacks almost always come in the night dastagir’s men are mostly nocturnal but made a show of checking passing vehicles thoroughly during aan’s daytime visit while dastagir laments the defensive posture he and the ansf have been ordered to uphold since doha he also clarifies that even under normal circumstances it is not the anp’s job to lead offensive operations “they are the responsibility of the ana” he said while the police follow in arrears to maintain a presence once areas have been cleared   his men still patrol the highway but only as far as the village of kochaye qazaq around two kilometres south the same afternoon that aan visited in july two humvees and an alp ranger laden with men swung south onto the highway from the road that leads up to the ana battalion headquarters they were on their way to kochaye qazaq the next night their checkpoint was attacked at least five members of government forces were killed and several wounded a local journalist told aan that fighting continued well into daylight hours on 20 july  the cost of their defensive posture—effectively waiting to be attacked— was beginning to take a toll on morale when aan visited kunduz in july “we need our leaders to make an agreement as soon as possible” said dastagir “we’re not happy with this situation”   muhammad yusef ayubi from the provincial council concurred “the idea of peace is good” he said “but the agreement was between the taleban and the us day by day the situation is getting worse”  the second time aan spoke with faizullah he was stonyfaced his demeanour betrayed the feeling typical of most of those on the government side aan spoke with in kunduz that since doha they have been saddled with the consequences of american attempts to make peace with the taleban an afghan soldier had been killed an hour earlier and the fighting continued on and off less than a minute up the highway “the foreigners made a peace deal” said faizullah “but us we keep dying”  in imam saheb district which had seen a spike in fighting in the month prior to aan’s july visit security officials had been instructed not to speak to reporters so most did so on the condition of anonymity one senior official from the district administration said that around 50 ansf had been killed in the month prior to midjuly   civilians were able to speak more freely about the increased pressure on the district abdul qarluk a 45yearold man who works as a gardener in the government headquarters said that “after the peace agreement every day and night the taleban have been trying to win control of the district how is this peace”   most of the casualties were occurring around the village of qarghaz three kilometres southeast of the district centre the frontline was marked by a narrow irrigation canal and most residents not on the governmentcontrolled side had left since the taleban had moved in the district official said he believed that taleban fighters from other provinces had been sent to kunduz to help push government forces back toward the district centre   inside the handful of frontline anp and alp outposts in qarghaz aan was told ten men had been killed at two of the posts in the past week alone including some ana soldiers sent to help defend the positions the taleban according to nezamuddin the commander of one small outpost were making concerted efforts to overrun them almost every second night the desperation of the defence was evident in the tunnels that had been dug from the periphery of the outposts not only leading to subterranean bunkers with groundlevel firing holes outside the boundary walls but to internal bunkers from which the police said they could fight when taleban fighters managed to breach the walls “the president has ordered all security personnel into a defensive position” he said “it is hard for us but these are our orders” his men had had to resort to such lastditchlike defences more than once in the past week the entrance to one such tunnel in an outpost in the village of joiye begum had been dug through the concrete floor of a room that was being used as sleeping quarters for the men “before the doha agreement” said nizamuddin “we were able to conduct operations… now there is a onesided ceasefire and the situation from our side is much worse than before”   motorists pass slowly through a security checkpoint at the northern gate to kunduz city as taleban and ana fight just a few hundred metres away to the north photo andrew quilty since aan visited kunduz in july fighting has continued across the province and worsened in imam saheb and khanabad a 25 august tolo news report found kunduz residents critical of the ansf for their reluctance to conduct offensive operations in the province the passivity they said was allowing the taleban to turn battlefield momentum in their favour the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha reported that over 9000 families had been displaced by fighting in the two districts in the last week of august  taleban checkpoints and ‘taxation’   the presence of taleban fighters and checkpoints on kunduz’s major roads has arguably been the greatest change for residents since doha muhammad yusef ayubi a member of the provincial council said the main complaints he received from his constituents now were about the province’s insecure highways ayubi singled out the kabulbaghlankunduz highway the “taleban” he said “control that highway and tax every vehicle” all those aan spoke with in kunduz who had travelled to or from kabul in recent months more or less concurred especially with regard to baghlan’s northern districts south of aliabad dastagir the police commander of the checkpoint at kunduz city’s southern gate through which motorists pass to travel on to aliabad baghlan and kabul said the highway between there and baghlan belongs to the taleban they are taxing drivers they were never able to do this before but” he remonstrated “we can’t do everything” ayoubi said truck drivers were forced to pay as much as 30000 afghanis 390 usd to pass through the taleban checkpoints   a bus passenger said taleban fighters were stopping vehicles taking mobile phones calling recently dialled numbers and telling those on the other end that their friend had been involved in an accident taking the guise of a helpful passerby the taleb would then ascertain relevant personal details that would determine whether the passenger had government affiliations and should be allowed to continue on their journey or not  rashida who recently remarried after losing her children and first husband—a member of the alp—to a us air strike in 2019 lives in dashte archi even though the taleban have dominated the district since at least 2015 rashida said that since doha they were coming onto the road far more frequently “if they make a checkpoint now” she said “it would take four hours to come to the city it takes a long time – they check everything” she added that such checkpoints are now most likely on thursdays – the day most people go to the city to shop at the bazaar “they check phones for songs they check memory cards” she told aan “they’re looking for salaam sim cards forbidden by the taleban because salaam is owned by the government they’ll fine you and send you to jail”   aside from the added difficulties associated with travel rashida told aan that the taleban had not otherwise changed much since doha she said she and the people were hopeful however that peace would come “because then we won’t have to provide food and things to taleban fighters this is a constant problem” she said “especially for the poor”  sayed malek runs a small shop on the far western edge of kunduz city where the lines of control begin to blur so much so that the taleban frequently request payments from him for electricity there are he said even police at frontline checkpoints who are required to pay the taleban because with power lines running through taleban territory failure to do so would mean their supply would be cut off   malek who lost one of his four sons fighting for the taleban fits a common mould among residents of areas longcontrolled by the taleban he is not necessarily protaleban but he is most certainly antigovernment “we support an islamic regime and the people that bring it” he said “we don’t necessarily want the taleban we want whoever brings an islamic regime” his ire on the other hand is focussed on those the americans chose to work with and how the benefits that were supposed to trickle down to families like his stayed in the pockets of american clients “they never asked the people whether they were happy to be represented by these people they have to end their support for the government then we’ll see what happens”   nangrahar  since 2015 conditions in nangrahar have been shaped to a large extent by the presence of the islamic state khorasan province iskp even after the group was declared “obliterated” by president ghani in the province in november 2019 its disruption to battlefield dynamics in the years that followed has continued to affect the state of play since the doha agreement was signed    map 3 nangrahar province lowlevel ansf pressure contains taleban     for its part the ansf’s strategy since february appears to have been about retaining the gains made since antiiskp operations began in 2017 those gains resulted from both antiiskp offensives by both the taleban and ansf in districts like khogyani and shirzad and a reinvigorated us aerial campaign all sides have claim responsible for victory – for more see this aan report before february according to a security analyst who was not permitted to speak publicly the convergence of sustained antiiskp activity in the preceding years saw the government—with the help of new progovernment ndsfunded uprising forces—holding territory it had not seen in years now the analyst said aside from “smaller operations against taleban safe houses around nangrahar the ansf strategy has been about containing the taleban where they ended up” after three years of almost nonstop military operations   in spite of taleban efforts that strategy according to gul shirin the commander of a small alp checkpoint on the main highway running north to south through khogyani has been successful pointing across a group of villages known as argach at the base of the white mountains spinghar in southern khogyani gul shirin said the whole area had been controlled by the taleban until government operations in early 2019 while they still maintain a minor presence “the taleban haven’t taken any territory in this area of nangrahar since doha” he told aan in early august “but they have tried”   the government he and other progovernment militia fighters say have continued to conduct operations since doha—a rare exception according to aan’s reporting in three provinces the difference now gul shirin told aan “is that previously the ana would have the support of us air power now they don’t” while the taleban have not been able to expand their presence in khogyani from predoha areas the halting of ground and air operations by us forces and nds02 has provided the taleban with breathing space “now the taleban can easily walk in the open” said gul shirin “they have heavy weapons mounted on vehicles now and don’t even have to hide them”  more foreign fighters more training    malik maki commander of khogyani’s uprising forces with 60 men between the district centre into the spinghar mountains to the south was critical of the repercussions of doha on his district his immediate concern was that his outposts which previously were under attack once or twice each month were now coming under fire more regularly because the taleban were no longer under military pressure his longterm concern however was that since us aerial operations had wound down after doha foreign fighters—among them he said pakistanis and chechens 4 —were flooding into khogyani from across the durand line maki claims the “taleban and their supporters want the taleban to come to power by force” several residents and analysts also told aan of the foreign influx in southwestern districts of nangrahar   security officials claimed to have killed 15 pakistani nationals in khogyani in july though the circumstances surrounding their deaths was not clear an ana regiment commander general karim niazi was reported by tolo in july as saying “intelligence information shows that there are retired pakistani colonels who are training the local taliban” also supporting this was a claim from pakistani politician and pashtun activist ali wazir on twitter who said that the bodies of dead pakistanis were being returned from afghanistan he asked “what are the priorities of the pakistani state”   the consensus among most of those aan spoke with was that the foreigners were taking advantage of the postdoha freedom to train rather than fight at least for the time being civilians and members of the ansf described influxes of external fighters in surkh rod and khogyani and in nangrahar’s most remote districts sherzad and hesarak wali a sherzad resident said fighters mostly from waziristan and the khyber agency had come and settled in areas the government had not managed to retake before doha without the threat of air strikes he said the groups who appear to wield power over local afghan fighters are conducting “large meetings without fear… they’re playing football and walking freely” the fear is that they are part of a buildup of military capacity that could be unleashed if intraafghan talks fall apart or fail to materialise at all   mounting frustration for some ansf  in some areas the taleban are still on the offensive against the iskp before iskp was dispelled from nangrahar their presence pushed some taleban groups into lesscontested areas including northern surkh rod where they were able to increase their attacks against government forces haji anar gul commands a small alp outpost in shamshapur close to the surkh rod district centre aan met him for the first time in july 2019 during a joint ana anp and alp operation to clear several villages of taleban around dashte baghwani at the foot of what locals call the black mountain because snow doesn’t fall on it this august anar gul was recovering at home in surkh rod after suffering a gunshot wound two weeks earlier when his outpost was overrun three of the five alp in the outpost were killed one of his sons was also wounded but survived    haji anar gul alp commander of an outpost surkh rod district of nangrahar speaks with friends at his home while recuperating from a bullet wound suffered when the taleban attacked his outpost two weeks before killing three of his men and wounding one of his sons photo andrew quilty when first interviewed during the operation in 2019 he said “one day after the operation the taleban were back” the clearing operation one year ago did however allow one new police outpost to be established on top of a small hilltop between the highway that runs through the district and the black mountain the outpost was still occupied by anp at the time of aan’s visit  anar gul’s recent experience was undoubtedly souring his views on the government and the forces behind the doha agreement “now the taleban are relaxed because they’re not afraid of air strikes” he said “no nds02 no special forces – the taleban were afraid of all these things but now nothing” he described the circumstances since doha as a onesided ceasefire with political manoeuvring only by a government that failed to take into account frontline realities “they’re attacking and we’re waiting to be attacked”   anar gul said that although new groups have entered the area it was local taleban commanders who were responsible for the recent attack one a group commander named mubarez he said called him after the worst of the fighting had died down ‘come on where are you come out’ he said through the phone anar gul was hiding behind a wall nearby and saw mubarez’s men shoot his son and try to steal his vehicle which would not start so they burned it instead “i saw everything” he said   people in kabul he said do not understand “in the districts we’re fighting we know how it is – the reality” furthermore he like many among the ansf that aan spoke with were sceptical of the intentions of those supposedly suing for peace “both sides are wasting their time they’re not working honestly toward peace” he said adding that there is “no hope there will not be peace even as an old person when i die i will not have known peace” when asked whether he planned to return to the outpost once he had recovered from his wound anar gul said “maybe i’ll go back but just for my local people not for the government”  civilians on a shifting frontline  hamesha gul lives beneath the new outpost on the small hill between the highway and the black mountain that was built in mid2019 since then he said security had improved significantly  he had left khogyani for surkh rod several years before so his children would not be pulled into the taleban’s growing orbit there but by 2018 in surkh rod he and his large extended family found themselves in a kind of no man’s land between the government forces on the highway and the taleban on the far side of the small hill where the outpost would be built mortars and rocketpropelledgrenades rpg would fall from the sky and explode around their house in the village of ibrahimkhel often several times each week bullet holes still scar the outer walls of their home from that time but it was an unexploded rpg picked up by one of his young children on their way to school in early 2018 that finally struck the family down hamesha gul’s sister and three children were killed and seven others were injured each losing at least part of one leg when one of them dropped the rocket outside the front door   last year’s joint ansf operation provided long overdue relief for hamesha gul and the surviving members of his family sighting the construction of the new outpost he told aan that “security was very good after the operation” but describing a pattern similar to what the vast majority of people whom aan spoke to for this report have described he said that since the doha agreement “the situation is worse” taleban assaults and mortar attacks on the outpost have become more frequent now at least he and his family are behind the government’s frontline position rather than in between the two frontlines as they had been previously  in khogyani despite the ansf having retaken much of the district last year the taleban are still far more active than in districts closer to jalalabad like surkh rod 72yearold khairullah described how his granddaughter had been killed when a munition was dropped from what he believed was an american aircraft on their way home during fighting in wazir tangi not long before the doha agreement was signed since doha khairullah said the incidence of roadside bombings and targeted killings of government officials and ansf members had increased khairullah was also critical of the behaviour of the insurgents toward local people suggesting that the number of nonafghans among them had increased since doha “if we ask them not to fight near our homes they reject our requests they search cars and demand ushr” but his anger is not only directed toward the taleban who he said were responsible for carrying out the majority of recent violence as much as the government and the americans who he said must make demands of pakistan if they truly want to end the war “we’re not happy with the government either” he said if the people had faith in the government khairullah said they would be more likely to support them at a local level then he suggested “maybe they will have success”  the security the government brings never lasts long enough for locals to commit to aligning with it instead for longterm survival they hedge their bets knowing from experience that the government does not have the capacity nor the resources to maintain security over an extended period and that supporting it would come back to bite soon enough yet khairullah still opposes the taleban and even as a victim of a us and government military operation khairullah cannot understand why the government has relinquished pressure on the taleban since doha “they’re inactive and ineffective” he said “they should start again – bombardments and 02 nds operations”  in sherzad 40yearold resident wali said the newfound freedom for local and foreigners fighting with or training the taleban has led to more rigour in their tax collection this is on top of the ten percent ushr on crop yield for farmers which has been in place for years for a truckload of stones coming from a mine in sherzad a 20000 afghani 260 usd fee is now payable all done out in the open said wali “now they’re scared of nothing”  conclusion  attitudes toward the doha agreement depend to a large degree on which side of the frontline one lives or fights   for the taleban and their sympathisers the agreement is seen as a reward for the sacrifices made during the 15year insurgency with the threat of being targeted by government or us forces now low morale among fighters has soared according to those aan spoke with the fight against the united states brought the agreement to withdraw and in the meantime to abstain from offensive operations that also brings the prospect of ultimate victory—whether by political or military means—closer than ever before fighters seem to be taking advantage of the absence of airstrikes to claim roads launch small to medium attacks against the ansf without overstepping their doha obligations and otherwise enjoy the drop in military pressure against them the increased presence of foreign fighters reported in maidan wardak and nangrahar however is disquieting for taleban fighters and residents alike  government forces are widely distrustful of american intentions and see the us as having made the doha agreement in bad faith with scant regard for the outcome for afghans themselves most of those who spoke to aan see the agreement as benefitting the us and the taleban at the expense of the afghan government and the ansf who they point out are still dying everyday most members of the ansf that aan spoke with also expressed frustration over the government’s sudden passivity toward the taleban after the severe taleban losses inflicted by last year’s intense us air campaign and the fear wrought by widespread night raids ghani’s orders after doha—to defend only— have allowed the taleban unfettered control in areas already under their sway and greater freedom to impose themselves in contested areas most notably on major roads and highways to many government and security officials regardless of whether it might serve the purported goal of peace the new orders are militarily weak and politically foolish  in this scenario the taleban have little incentive to reduce violence they are rarely having to defend themselves nowadays so an overall reduction in operational tempo – the closest thing the insurgency has ever had to downtime – will continue to allow them to focus on training consolidating their control where they can planning for future contingencies or simply recuperating although the taleban do not appear to be focused on largescale territorial conquest for now they have taken advantage of the lull in offensive operations against them by consolidating their control around the urban centres which they might in the future want to attack particularly if the threat of us air strikes went away entirely meanwhile the current defensive posture makes the ansf vulnerable to attack has meant a rise in casualty rates and depressed morale this is not sustainable   edited by rachel reid and kate clark  1 the earlier reports were  aan team voices from the districts the violence mapped 1 what has happened since the

353,shared indous strategic concerns over china will continue to deepen security cooperation but the modi government might not get the free ride on domestic affairs it enjoyed during the trump era on the surface us presidentelect joe biden’s elevation to the highest office in the land spells the end of a fouryear bonhomie between donald trump and india’s hindu nationalist prime minister narendra modi however it is shortsighted to assume that relations between the world’s oldest democracy and its largest one have ever been based on an ideological affinity between their leaders for over the past two decades successive american presidents have underlined strong ties with india the 2005 nuclear deal under george w bush jr’s presidency marked a generational leap in bilateral ties and set the stage for a strategic partnership and new delhi became the lynchpin in president barack obama’s ‘pivot to asia’ calculus trump has built on it and advanced the relationship further and there is no reason why biden won’t maintain that strategic momentum while modi will miss the flattery and ceremonial pomp from ‘namaste trump’ to ‘howdy modi’ what he might miss the most is the free ride he enjoyed at the hands of the trump administration on the domestic front “india was lucky to have donald trump the least concerned us president on the issues of human rights violations” says dr gareth price senior research fellow of the asiapacific programme at chatham house feared by some in india is a democratic administration that pushes the government on issues related to religious freedom civil liberties and excessive force in kashmir and judging by comments made by both biden and harris modi’s government could come under much heavier scrutiny from the top in his agenda for muslimamerican communities biden condemned the caa – the modi government’s controversial new citizenship act – and a separate attempt to build a population register nrc that could provide future justification to expel foreigners calling them projects “inconsistent with the country’s long tradition of secularism and with sustaining a multiethnic and multireligious democracy” kashmir also features on biden’s agenda for muslim americans “in kashmir the indian government should take all necessary steps to restore rights for all the people of kashmir” it says on the biden campaign’s website “restrictions on dissent such as preventing peaceful protests or shutting or slowing down the internet weaken democracy” harris has been even more outspoken “we have to remind kashmiris that they are not alone in the world” she said back in october 2019 when she was campaigning for president during the democratic primaries “there is a need to intervene if the situation demands” and in december 2019 harris publicly criticised indian external affairs minister subramanyan jaishankar after he refused to meet indianorigin congresswoman pramila jayapal over her denunciation of the modi government’s abrogation of article 370 in jammu and kashmir a disputed territory between india and pakistan since 1947 the role of china the indian economy is reeling and defence modernisation is in a fiscal rut and in desperate need of reform – no matter the state narrative claims of a handful of rafale aircraft tilting the balance against china when it comes to china india faces what it views as a triple sino threat on its border in its regional sphere of influence and in the indian ocean the indopacific region will remain an important theatre of us strategic interest and it is likely to push for greater cooperation among major democracies like india and other two quadrilateral security dialogue quad partners japan and australia in a bid to counterbalance china’s expanding geopolitical influence in august biden said he would back india against “threats on the border” without explicitly mentioning china in the end it is a land war in asia not a maritime dispute that is at the forefront of sinoindian tensions says price “the number one threat for india isn’t chinese naval bases in sri lanka its immediate challenge is that it has hundreds of troops up in the himalayas and the chinese have proper routes to reinforce them while the indians don’t” but the rivalry between india and china isn’t just about the military but on issues like technology and infrastructural development too after tensions escalated significantly over the summer between the two india retaliated by banning 59 chinese apps in the country then the two armies clashed high in the himalayas on their disputed border resulting in the death of troops on both sides while trump’s erratic “america first” policy alternated between dealmaking and dealbreaking with beijing biden is expected to advance multilateralism and lessen direct confrontation which india might find concerning if us policy shifts from hardening against china to go after russia it could leave india further conflicted but at a more fundamental level the process of decoupling with beijing that trump initiated is likely to continue under biden albeit more systematically and with less fanfare challenges will remain on the economic front but it might be easier for new delhi to negotiate on issues that were complicated by the trump administration’s transactional approach for one it could try to push for a resumption of the gspplus generalised system of preferences on grounds that it would provide a boost to indias pandemichit economy and enhance its capacity to take on china india will also benefit from biden’s promise to reverse trump’s restrictions on employmentbased visas such as the h1b and permanent resident cards why afghanistan matters price argues that afghanistan could well be the crux in how the usindia relationship evolves under biden “if there is more interest in a sustainable afghan peace process than a kind of stitched up deal to get troops out – then you have to deal with pakistan questions which are then linked to indian questions” and that’s where kashmir comes into play because of its implications for pakistan which has implications for afghanistan price asserts “say afghanistan goes well there are concerns in india that the taliban come and play up in kashmir the message coming from the us if it were to take a human rights angle would be to say that you’re india endangering your own security through how kashmir is being handled” this could mean greater outspokenness by the us on issues that would likely also be driven by washington’s ongoing need to reengage pakistan to ensure its continued support in fostering the peace process in afghanistan and could see the us take stronger action towards any unilateral moves by india to alter the status quo in kashmir but how that will go down in new delhi is anyone’s guess what will biden’s priority be in south asia will it be countering china or will it be sorting out afghanistan either one will have consequences for indian foreign policy this article has been adapted from its original source,3

55,perspectives november 20 2020  some tactics have been productive but others are fueling a backlash research director for china hong kong and taiwan sarahgcook   over the past decade the ability of the chinese communist party ccp to influence global media has expanded dramatically including online since 2018 however this effort has become more brazen and aggressive often provoking pushback against beijing when it veers toward especially coercive or underhanded behavior an analysis of developments from the last two months offers some insight on where the regime’s campaign is gaining traction where it is backfiring and what to watch for in the months to come revelations from october point to three areas where the chinese government has developed a strong—and arguably growing—foothold despite expressions of concern about its impact or concrete action taken by some individuals to push back first beijing has made progress in its bid to monitor and control international data traffic the united nations appears on track to open two data hubs in china one for “global geospatial knowledge” and the other for “big data for sustainable development goals” an article by researcher claudia rossett in the wall street journal notes that memorandums of intent have already been signed and two locations in zhejiang province have been selected thus even as an increasing number of countries move to exclude chinese firms like huawei from their telecommunications infrastructure or otherwise voice concerns about surveillance the chinese government is using its powerful influence at the united nations to develop potentially massive access to satellite information and data flows from around the world the partnership adds a un stamp of legitimacy to beijing’s initiative and offers the regime an opportunity to more effectively shape technical standards according to its authoritarian vision or to monitor communist party critics abroad second the regime is stepping up interference in the domestic political discourse of foreign countries on september 22 facebook announced that it had removed a network of accounts pages and groups on its platforms that originated in china and had engaged in inauthentic behavior targeting southeast asian countries in particular the philippines this campaign stands out among other efforts by chinalinked accounts in that much of the activity went beyond the common focus on chinarelated content such as events in hong kong or the philippines’ territorial dispute with china targeting local audiences with material in filipino and english that appeared to favor or disfavor domestic political actors—for example by promoting president rodrigo duterte and criticizing the independent news organization rappler moreover relative to many of the accounts in similar campaigns that have been taken down recently these appeared to gain more traction garnering over 130000 followers and millions of interactions several factors might have contributed to this success including the widespread use of facebook in the philippines the polarized political landscape and the already close relationship chinese state media have established with the presidential communications team third ccp political preferences are seeping ever deeper into the international videogame industry when shanghaibased game developer mihoyo launched genshin impact in late september it was hailed as the biggest global launch of a chinese game to date but the long shadow of ccp censorship soon became evident in the program’s ingame chat function politically sensitive words ranging from “hong kong” and “taiwan” to “falun gong” and even “putin” are reportedly converted to asterisks wellknown gamer kazuma hashimoto posted a clip on twitter to illustrate the problem and announced that he “can’t play it in good conscience” hashimoto said last year that he was quitting games made by a usbased company blizzard after it punished a hong kong esports player for expressing support for prodemocracy protesters despite such highprofile boycotts however the reality is that several internationally popular chinese and foreignmade games—including tencent’s lucrative pubg mobile game—have implemented similar restrictions for some time marking a quiet victory for the globalization of mundane ccp censorship efforts to reverse this trend face an uphill battle given the scale of downloads in china—home to the world’s largest population of mobile web users—and apathy among many international gamers other attempts by chinese officials or companies to gain access to data or impose their preferred narrative on foreigners have met with refusals or galvanized countercampaigns  in france chinese officials attempted to pressure a museum in nantes to rewrite portions of an upcoming exhibit on the medieval mongol ruler genghis khan among other requests they called for the removal of key terms like “genghis khan” “empire” and “mongol” the head of the museum refused and announced instead that the opening of the exhibit would be suspended “in the name of the human scientific and ethical values we defend” tentatively postponing it to october 2024 the show was initially arranged in cooperation with a museum in china’s inner mongolia region but according to the french museum director the central authorities in china tried to intervene and revise the exhibit synopsis in a manner that would “erase” mongol history in keeping with a new more aggressively assimilationist ccp policy that has prompted widespread protests and a subsequent crackdown in inner mongolia since august in india the chinese embassy sent a letter on october 7 to approximately 250 local journalists demanding that they “not violate the onechina principle” when reporting on taiwan’s upcoming october 10 national day and avoid referring to taiwan as a country or to its democratically elected leader tsai ingwen as a president the letter included an implicit threat that noncompliant outlets could lose access to the chinese embassy however after an indian journalist with over 280000 followers posted the letter to twitter it circulated widely provoked a tart reply from taiwan’s minister of foreign affairs and drew a declaration from india’s foreign ministry that “there is a free media in india that reports on issues that they see fit” the chinese embassy’s pressure also prompted indian netizens to piggyback on the taiwannationalday hashtag while indian journalists with large followings shared a thankyou post from tsai helping the holiday go viral in india such solidarity among prodemocracy forces and critics of beijing has also extended to hong kong and thailand in what has been dubbed the milk tea alliance a loose network of activists from the two locations have offered mutual support for their respective political struggles on social media the network gained strength in early 2020 as a way to push back against nationalistic chinese users and bots swarming major platforms and trying to drown out prodemocracy voices one thai student leader told the atlantic “everyone in the alliance is the victim of china and its authoritarianism” in late october the associated hashtag milkteaalliance got a viral boost amid a new round of prodemocracy protests in thailand with hong kong activists expressing solidarity in posts that were shared and liked thousands of times in the realm of data access what began as a usdriven campaign to encourage other countries particularly in europe to exclude chinese technology giant huawei from their new fifthgeneration 5g mobile phone networks has taken on a life of its own a growing list of countries have raised national security concerns and refused to grant the chinese firm greater influence at a time when beijing is aggressively attempting to impose its content standards abroad romania became the latest european state to announce a ban on huawei on november 1 following sweden’s declaration last month that it would be banning huawei and another chinese company zte from its 5g infrastructure other countries including poland estonia and bulgaria have agreed to work with the united states on 5g cybersecurity or otherwise collaborate on highspeed wireless network technology it is clear that beijing has made a strategic decision to adopt a more aggressive posture towards foreign news outlets and global social media platforms seeking to manipulate conversations even on topics not directly related to china what remains to be seen is how they adapt and whether they become adept at more subtle—and thus more effective—manipulation such adaptation could help beijing overcome a key stumbling block its evident lack of understanding of global internet culture democratic norms and civil society engagement tactics deployed at home—like amplifying nationalistic netizens at the expense of prodemocracy voices—may be less effective in certain foreign contexts and even trigger a backlash  looking ahead it remains important to watch for any meaningful inroads the ccp and its proxies might make in influencing foreign news environments how tactics are adjusted and improved what obstacles they encounter and whether these vary depending on the strength of democratic institutions in the target country the most important developments may not always be

184,read the diplomat know the asiapacific an increasingly fractured international system along with lack of a meaningful hierarchy of threats is making prospects of arms control difficult looking downwards into the silo of a genuine titan ii icbm at the titan missile museum south of tucson arizona the titan ii was decommissioned in 1987 the international arms control system has seen better days under the trump administration the us withdrew from the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty the open skies treaty and the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa while leaving the last remaining usrussia nuclear arms accord new start dangling by a thread meanwhile trump’s sole major arms control initiative personal negotiations with kim jong un generated no meaningful progress the incoming biden administration has signaled that it intends to reverse many of trump’s withdrawals but at least some of them are functionally irreversible beyond the immediate churn the problem is that the us has become much more resistant to such negotiations new start ratified in 2010 was the last major arms control agreement that cleared the bar and an increasingly partisan senate 23 of which is required for ratification seems less and less willing to acquiesce to new ones that puts international agreements solely into the purview of the presidency which cannot guarantee them beyond its term in office that is not to say that arms control is wholly dead the last decade has seen some new international implements enter into force notably the arms trade treaty att and the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons tpnw but those implements are better as mechanisms to set longterm norms than to produce shortterm outcomes the att is broad and lacks an enforcement mechanism and the tpnw has not been ratified by any country that either possesses or has a plausible strategic rationale for developing nuclear weapons meanwhile the world continues to arm itself that is true of conventional armaments and — crucially — of newer and potentially transformative ones as well for example armed drones have gone from a curiosity to a major force in the full spectrum of armed conflict in less than two decades but the mechanisms that might regulate their sale or use were designed long beforehand and are not fit for purpose get briefed on the story of the week and developing stories to watch across the asiapacific similarly there is no formal mechanism to regulate the development of offensive cyber capabilities or restrict their use within or outside the boundaries of declared war nor does a formal instrument exists that restricts the development or use of autonomous weapons certainly both topics have been heavily studied and working groups exist under un auspices and elsewhere to try to agree a framework around which regulation could be designed but that is several crucial stages short of exercising meaningful control enjoying this article click here to subscribe for full access just 5 a month the question is do new mechanisms to control novel implements and tactics of war stand a chance in an environment where existing ones are losing traction or put another way can arms control mechanisms bind the fractures in the international system or are they only possible when the system is basically working the 1960s — a decade which saw nearly every possible combination of intra and interstate war and the human race’s closest brush with nuclear annihilation for good measure — also gave us the nuclear nonproliferation treaty the outer space treaty the partial test ban treaty and others so there is reason to think that even a sharply divided world can find ways to manage threats but by the same token the potential of nuclear weapons to obliterate human civilization and the overarching political narrative of the capitalist west versus the communist east also channeled political energy into workable solutions that all parties could support there is no such clarity today either in terms of political alignment or the hierarchy of threats notwithstanding its general hostility to multilateralism one of the trump administration’s salient points against the cold warera arms control treaties is that they were mostly bilateral agreements between the us and russia without effect on the world’s current secondlargest military power china but china substantially lags behind both the us and russia in total and deployed warhead numbers and in delivery systems having concluded that a few hundred warheads primarily mounted on roadmobile icbms are sufficient to deter nuclear attack from the united states freeing up capital to invest in other capabilities a treaty like new start would only work with china if the us were willing to make much more substantial cuts to its nuclear arsenal than it has ever seriously considered that is not to say that bilateral agreements between the us and russia are pointless — far from it in addition to reducing the low probability but astronomically high impact risk of nuclear war between the two biggest nuclear powers such agreements also demonstrate the essential ingredients of broader deescalatory measures transparency flexibility and good faith to say that those ingredients have recently been lacking from the us approach to reducing risk is to state the obvious even if the us is far from being the only offender or even the most egregious but no worthwhile treaty was ever agreed between partners acting in pure good faith and a sense of shared responsibility instead arms control has long served as a means by which imperfect nations agree to moderate risk in the name of mutual selfinterest despite the low tenor of the current moment there exists an opportunity to use that framework to manage new challenges — but it would help to start with better managing the wellknown ones  jacob parakilas is an author consultant and analyst working on us foreign policy and

leads a small but influential cadre of senior leaders widely called alqa‘ida core the group’s   cohesiveness the past three years has diminished because of leadership   losses from counterterrorism pressure in afghanistan and pakistan and   the rise of other organizations such as the islamic state of iraq and   the levant isil that serve as an alternative for some disaffected   extremists the 2015 deaths of nasir alwahishi and abu khalil alsudani two of alqa‘ida’s most experienced top leaders has hindered the organization’s core functions  nonetheless alqa‘ida and its affiliates in south   asia africa and the middle east remain a resilient organization   committed to conducting attacks in the united states and against   american interests abroad the group has advanced a number of   unsuccessful plots in the past several years including against the   united states and europe this highlights alqa‘ida’s   ability to continue some attack preparations while under sustained   counterterrorism pressure and suggests it may be plotting additional   attacks against the united states at home or overseas looking ahead to 2016 alqa‘ida could seek to reconstitute its remnants in afghanistan and place greater emphasis on smaller attacks against soft targets alqa‘ida continues to aspire to conduct largescale   attacks however and its historical ties to afghanistan make the   country an attractive operating area especially if the group can   leverage its longstanding relationships with afghan insurgents who   supported it in the years preceding 911

360,estonia must find a balance between the us and europe the summit of the three seas initiative and an associated business forum that were originally supposed to take place in the spring would have been landmarks in estonia’s foreignpolicy calendar this year the event now planned will be much more modest as befits the coronavirus era the meeting will be held via video what is the three seas initiative the three seas initiative tsi is an idea launched in 2015 by the presidents of croatia and poland with support from the us with the aim of developing and creating transport energy and digital sector connections and infrastructure along a northsouth axis in central and eastern europe so far 12 countries have joined austria bulgaria croatia the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania poland romania slovakia and slovenia the european commission germany and the us are partners of the project 1 this is an ambitious venture the main aim apparently taken from an oldschool us textbook on diplomacy bring together several small and mediumsized countries to expand their influence and power through cooperation as we know in eastern europe the northsouth axis runs through smaller countries whose markets are too small to interest investors however if these countries were to take on joint projects investment would start to make sense the role of us taxpayers in this is small us secretary of state mike pompeo has announced that the us government will provide seed money of up to one billion dollars 2 in us terms this is a pittance in addition contributions are expected from the countries that joined the initiative of which poland romania estonia latvia and hungary have already promised to provide their share of the budget it is hoped a total of three to five billion euros will be collected this money will go towards the three seas initiative investment fund managed by a supervisory board on a commercial basis all this is still an idea but the framework is slowly taking shape the investment fund has been established ministers are communicating and making plans while the purpose of the forthcoming summit is to increase the practicability of the partnership and hone its details i have heard the project is unofficially known as the new marshall plan for europe referring to the economic aid the us provided to europe after world war ii there are several suggested projects that the investment fund could support although some of them are questionable a lot of emphasis is placed on creating energy connections on the northsouth axis so as to disconnect eastern and central europe from their historical ties to russia—for example by constructing an lng terminal on the island of krk in croatia from where gas would be piped to hungary and slovakia 3 estonia is interested in developing digital connections eg creating a digital highway to enhance data sharing at the same time some of the suggested projects are already underway and supported by the european commission such as the gas interconnector between poland and lithuania similarly estonia has submitted rail baltic and the synchronisation of the baltic energy networks which the european commission has already greenlighted as its pilot projects thus the role of the tsi and the investments that flow from it is questionable the eu and germany given the european location of the regional effort one might ask whether the tsi is related to the eu and if so how this issue is the weakest part of the initiative’s design which shows that the us played a large part in developing the project which explains the rather lukewarm reaction from the european partners and their low level of engagement in the early stages of the project here we run into a considerable problem the national investments by estonia and other participating states are already closely connected to eu projects this means that it is complicated to find new funding for and offer guarantees to new projects in addition current eu projects include a growing set of principles that member states follow for the nordic and baltic states the infrastructure to be constructed must allow for the transit of military equipment within the region are investors prepared for the additional expense needed to follow these standards the eu has a major role in leading crossborder infrastructure projects and it is difficult for third parties to get in on the game the fact that washington did not foresee this is surprising and perhaps indicates that the us does not understand how things are done in the eu failing to involve the eu and germany gave rise to negative feedback in the early stages the tsi was seen as an antieu and antigermany undertaking president donald trump’s personal support further exacerbated western european criticism germany’s involvement is still not certain due to poland’s opposition and thus the country is a partner rather than an official participant but the president of germany will take part in the forthcoming summit 4 leaving germany out highlights another question yet to be discussed does estonia want a direct connection to southern europe and if so to what extent for estonia it is crucial for both security and economic reasons to have a reliable connection with germany and the rest of western europe that lies beyond it the 12 states the list of countries that participate in the tsi challenges all kinds of mental maps that divide europe into sections based on various characteristics those who have had the chance to hear edward lucas talking about the nature of eastern europe will know what i mean 5 the involvement of austria is not sufficient to call the initiative an eastern european venture so it is strange that georgette mosbacher the us ambassador to poland referred to soviet history in relation to the initiative 6 however the tsi brings a fresh angle to this constant search for identity if we look at these countries together the combination seems odd by today’s standards to quote one diplomat “what do we estonia have in common with bulgaria” this may be an erudite question but it has a point the countries often do not share common interests in the eu and prefer to cooperate in regional partnerships like the baltic states the visegrád group and the bulgaria–romania tandem austria is the most unusual member of the group the tsi is also a digression from the general principle of estonia’s europe policy based on which it has tried to stay away from various eastern european groupings sometimes this cannot be avoided but active participation in the venture raises the question whether the policy is changing the three seas initiative vs 171 the geopolitical importance of the tsi has grown since it was launched while the project’s geopolitical angle initially proceeded from the aim of weakening eastern and central europe’s ties to russia in the past few years the project seems to be increasingly “against china” the 171 initiative—the multilateral cooperation network headed by china—is the crown jewel of beijing’s foreign policy 7 us global power is about bringing countries together and facilitating their cooperation and 171 is an example of china trying to create a similar capability the two formats have similar memberships but 171 includes albania bosnia and herzegovina greece north macedonia montenegro and serbia the other 12 overlap and thus it is difficult to argue that the two initiatives are not in competition it is too early to claim that this is a battlefield in the global struggle between china and the us but it would still be wise to keep an eye out for it although the future of both formats is undecided the decision by the trump administration to support the tsi is reason enough to talk about it today it was the obama administration’s baby and it is logical to presume that joe biden would support it but one cannot be sure that things will remain the same if he is elected president the future of 171 is even more uncertain while washington may be safe in the knowledge that the countries involved want to cooperate with it this is not true for china attitudes in europe towards china have become rather negative in the past two years moreover 171 lacks substance and its members are beginning to voice their concerns loudly besides a few fancy photo ops with chinese leaders the format has no results to show and has no future estonian foreign minister urmas reinsalu has said that estonia should leave 171 8 vilnius is also dissatisfied while the latvians tend to express their opinions more cautiously there are several choices available leaving individually or as part of a group or remaining a member but investing only a minimal amount of resources whatever the decision it will have a negative effect on relations with china the tsi and estonian foreign policy those who follow estonian foreign policy will have noticed how the tsi gives rise to opposing opinions it has the political support of president kersti kaljulaid and is backed by the government at stenbock house foreign minister reinsalu is a stalwart proponent but the initiative is frowned upon by diplomats foreignpolicy observers and analysts moreover it has highlighted the fault lines between supporters of europe and of the us one does not rule out the other but there are conflicts when stakeholders must decide whether estonian foreign policy needs to prioritise relations with the us or with europe 9 balance is the key here and estonia’s biggest concern is that european and us interests might contradict each other for estonia both europe and the us are extremely important mainly from the point of view of security but also in economic terms this is why president trump’s policy of setting europe against the us is the most significant foreignpolicy development from this continent’s perspective in the last four years as a result we must cultivate both relationships in parallel and estonia cannot allow the differences between europe and the us to be highlighted to its disadvantage or decide that today is the best day for making existential decisions the tsi’s most important added value for estonian foreign policy is in providing tallinn with a direct connection to the white house and foggy bottom home of the us state department— ed  estonia has something to talk about with washington and amidst the pandemonium in which each country is fighting for us attention this amounts to political capital that should not be underestimated that is why political support for the initiative in tallinn is solid from washington’s point of view this means that if the white house lost interest in the tsi it is highly likely that estonia and several other countries would contribute considerably less to the format it is clear the european partners have their selfinterest in mind and there is no use denying it the initiative highlights the weak point in estonianus relations they are too focused on security but it can serve the purpose of diversifying the relationship in the hope of strengthening the economic axis in addition to security and military cooperation over time the tighter the ties between estonia and the us the stronger and more sustainable the bilateral and multilateral partnership will be from a regional perspective estonia stands out as a leader and if the format is successful it will be a diplomatic victory for the country there is a reservation however president kersti kaljulaid has a big role in leading the initiative just as with the us elections we must consider the possibility that if a new estonian president is elected estonia’s role in the tsi and its leadership may change conclusion a single critic can criticise more than ten movers and shakers can achieve and this also applies to the three seas initiative several aspects of the venture invite scrutiny from the nature of the projects to the limited overlap of participants’ interests at the same time estonia and the entire region tend to suffer from a lack of ideas and strategic partnerships we will see whether and if so how the tsidevelops but i think the idea and its level of ambition are commendable it should be simply decided how much to invest and what field would suffer as a result if this is european solidarity i would be concerned where does the perfect balance lie and are the stakeholders even trying to find it,3

187,read the diplomat know the asiapacific fijian prime minister frank bainimarama has extended an invitation to biden to travel to fiji in august 2021 for the pacific islands forum the election of joe biden as the next president of the united states is providing some much needed relief for the rest of the world for pacific island states biden’s commitment to have the united states rejoin the paris climate agreement will be greatly welcomed as i wrote in early october fijian prime minister frank bainimarama gave remarks to the recent united nations general assembly urging other countries to remain committed to the ideals of multilateralism as the world’s most powerful country the commitment of the united states to these ideals is essential to the successful functioning of multilateral bodies  for small countries like the pacific island states crucial to being able to negotiate the international community successfully is having larger powers understand and internalize their interests and concerns this is usually a task for australia and canberra has begun to take this role more seriously due to recent strategic competition from china in the south pacific however on the pacific’s most pressing concern — climate change — the australian government has proved itself less than helpful and frequently obstructionist  under president donald trump the united states pulling out of the paris agreement provided cover for australia in its own recalcitrance on efforts to combat climate change however a biden white house that is committed to serious action on the issue will make it more difficult for australia to simply avoid taking its own obligations seriously for pacific island states this will be a positive shift in the global influence required to address their concerns  yet for bainimarama simply resting on the power shift in washington and hoping that this will prove beneficial to the pacific has not been enough for him there is a strong need for the biden administration to receive a firsthand account of the effects climate change is having on the region in this vein bainimarama has extended an invitation to biden to travel to fiji in august 2021 when the country will be hosting the annual pacific islands forum leaders’ summit get briefed on the story of the week and developing stories to watch across the asiapacific of course the united states is heavily invested throughout the pacific through its affiliated pacific island territories american samoa north mariana islands and guam are observers at pif the three independent countries in free association with the united states — the federated states of micronesia the marshall islands and palau — are full members of the forum yet the most recent senior us attendee of the pif leaders’ summit was secretary of state hilary clinton who attended the summit hosted by the cook islands in 2012 enjoying this article click here to subscribe for full access just 5 a month were biden to attend the 2021 summit it would be a strong demonstration of his administration’s priorities pacific islands make negligible contributions to climate change yet disproportionately feel its effects therefore there is no more compelling signal that larger more powerful countries are giving the issue the importance it deserves than by making the effort to engage with the leadership of pacific island countries in a genuine and committed manner the pacific is — for want of a better word — the coalface of climate change  the presence of biden at pif 2021 would also serve to regulate australia’s behavior at last year’s forum pacific island leaders felt that prime minister scott morrison was both dismissive of their concerns about climate change and insulting toward them as they tried to make their case to pif’s most powerful member the australian delegation also tried to water down the forum’s communiqué by removing all references to coal the protection of australia’s large coal industry from attempts to decarbonize the country’s economy as well as the technological change that would make it redundant remains a highly political issue in australia it is an issue that the governing conservative coalition refuses to confront and the opposition labor party is internally conflicted by  this persistent feature of australian politics remains a major barrier to the pacific’s most pressing requirements however the election of joe biden — and his professed commitments to more significant action to reduce global carbon emissions — may change these calculations it will place greater pressure on australia to overcome its current climate insolence and potentially move it into a position where it can become a sympathetic advocate for the pacific’s needs were biden to also attend next year’s pif leaders’ summit his ability to gain a firsthand understanding of the predicament pacific states find themselves in also has the potential for these countries to gain the most powerful ally in their existential challenge   grant wyeth is a melbournebased political analyst specializing in australia and the pacific india and canada,3
124,alnusrah front is one of the most capable alqa‘idaaffiliated   groups operating in syria during the ongoing conflict the group in   january 2012 announced its intention to overthrow syrian president   bashar alasad’s regime and since then has mounted hundreds of insurgentstyle   and suicide attacks against regime and security service targets across   the country the group is committed not only to ousting the regime but   also seeks to expand its reach regionally and globally initially alnusrah front did not publicize its links to alqa‘ida in iraq or pakistan the islamic state of iraq and the levant isil played a significant   role in founding the group isil predecessor organizations used syria as   a facilitation hub and transformed this facilitation and logistics   network into an organization capable of conducting sophisticated   explosives and firearms attacks isil leaders since the beginning of alnusrah front’s participation in the conflict provided their facilitation hub with personnel and resources including money and weapons during 2013 alnusrah front and isil were consumed by a public rift stemming from isil leader abuâ bakr albaghdadi’s april 2013 statement announcing the creation of isil and claiming the merger of both groups alnusrah front and isil have strategies for syria and a public merger between them probably would have undermined alnusrah front’s autonomy in the country in april 2013 alnusrah front’s leader abu muhammad aljawlani pledged allegiance to alqa‘ida leader ayman alzawahiri during early 2014 the rift between alnusrah front and isilâin which isil has openly accused alqa‘ida senior leaders of deviating from what it perceives as the correct militant pathâhas taken place not just on the ground but in social media as well alnusrah front’s   leaders probably have learned lessons from members’ previous   experiences in iraq and have sought to win over the syrian populace by   providing parts of the country with humanitarian assistance and basic   civil services several syriabased armed opposition groups cooperate and fight alongside sunni extremist groups including alnusrah front and are dependent upon them for expertise training and weapons alnusrah front has managed to seize territory including military bases and infrastructure in northern syria the group’s cadre is predominately composed of syrian   nationals many of whom are veterans of previous conflicts including   the iraq war thousands of fighters from around the world have traveled   to syria since early 2012 to support oppositionist groups and some   fighters aspire to connect with alnusrah front and other extremist groups several westerners have joined alnusrah   front including a few who have died in suicide operations western   government officials have raised concerns that capable individuals with   extremist contacts and battlefield experience could return to their home   countries to commit violent acts an alnusrah front

197,the bellingcat investigation team is an award winning group of volunteers and full time investigators who make up the core of the bellingcats investigative efforts a note about the uk arms project this article forms part of a series of investigations that will look at uk arms exports it has been produced by bellingcat lighthouse reports and their media partners sky news and the guardian investigators involved were leone hadavi benjamin strick annique mossou pieter van huis eric woods ross higgins and ludo hekman part one featured here will look at sniper rifles sold by a uk arms company part two will focus on equipment used by us police at recent black lives matter protests while part three will explore the sale of recoilless rifles used by saudi arabia in the ongoing yemen conflict while the uk is renowned for big ticket arms exports such as the ef typhoon and tornado fighter jets it also has a thriving lightweapons industry  these reports will look to see where ukmade small arms end up and whether in granting licenses for such sales the uk is living up to its claim of having strict and rigorous arms export controls  these investigations are part of the larger eu arms project initiated by lighthouse reports which looks to document and track how eumanufactured weapons are used the project has setup newsrooms in eight major arms exporting countries and thus far investigated close to 100 export agreements you can read more about the euarms project here the record breaking sniper rifle accuracy international ai a british based firearms manufacturer has made a name for itself selling sniper rifles around the world its products are renowned for their reliability durability and are generally considered as some of the best on the market  the range of the rifle can provide a warring party with a significant advantage over its opponents – back in 2009 british soldiers used the rifle to take out two taliban fighters in afghanistan from a distance of 2475 meters thereby breaking what was then the “world record” of longest recorded sniper kills the rifle has been exported to many countries around the globe we traced a few of these exports and tried to reconstruct the full circle from license to export to actual deployment  while doing so however we began to wonder whether uk arms export control mechanisms were effective given some of the locations we saw these weapons appearing in the uk is a signatory to the international treaty on arms trade att which looks to regulate the crossborder trade in conventional arms it has also implemented the eu common position on arms exports and has its own domestic rules that aim to prevent licenses being granted when there is a risk recipients would use them aggressively against another country or for internal repression these rules also state that caution must be taken in granting licences on a casebycase basis and taking account of the nature of the equipment to countries where serious violations of human rights have been established in responding to the research conducted for the uk arms project a uk government spokesperson said the country operates “one of the most comprehensive export control regimes in the world” and “rigorously assesses all export licences in accordance with strict licensing criteria” yet despite that we were able to find accuracy international sniper rifles appearing in russia’s volatile north caucasus region as well as conflict zones in ukraine yemen and syria  accuracy international did not respond to requests for comment for the uk arms project before publication there is no suggestion of any illegality on their part saudi sales uk sniper rifle sales to saudi arabia have increased in recent years even as saudi forces have engaged in a brutal conflict in neighbouring yemen documents submitted by the uk to the arms trade treaty show that 663 sniper rifles were exported to saudi arabia in 2017 a year earlier that figure stood at 290 at the same time data collected by the campaign against the arms trade caat from uk strategic export controls reports shows that 23 licenses have been granted for the sale of sniper rifles to saudi arabia since 2008 of these 18 are standard licenses siels standard issue export licenses which can be used to send a single shipment overseas and five are ‘open’ licenses oitcls open individual trade control license of the five open licenses end destination notes are available for two of them a 2017 oitcl granted the sale of sniper rifles among other things for “antipiracy operations civiliancommercial end use” a 2016 oiel was granted for “for accessories  spare parts armed forces end use” the 18 siels were granted with the following destination notes  through data provided in response to freedom of information requests by caat we were able to see that accuracy international applied for a license to sell ml1a items detailed in the image below to saudi arabia at least seven times over the period between september 2007 and december 2015 given the foi request was submitted in 2016 it is possible that ai applied for more licenses to sell ml1a items after these dates yet due to paucity of the data in the siel and oitcl end notes it is not possible to say which if any of the approved licenses were awarded to accuracy international  but what if we were to take a look at the weapons that appear to be being used by the saudi armed forces in training and in the field images posted to unofficial and enthusiast instagram pages that celebrate the saudi army and navy appear to show uniformed men holding rifles that bear a very close resemblance to the ai arctic warfare series model as seen below while this cannot be taken as full confirmation given the unofficial nature of the instagram pages it does align with the hypothesis that ai rifles had been sold to the saudi navy  image pictures posted to instagram that appear to show saudi forces with ai rifles original sources here here here here and here the absence of an adjustable cheekpiece in the instagram images appears to indicate these rifles belong to the arctic warfare aw model publicised in this official accuracy international brochure from 2005  barrels as demonstrated by the variety of those showcased in social media posts and in the brochure are changeable and vary in calibre but all can be mounted in the arctic warfare chassis  locating accuracy international rifles in yemen on december 10 2015 the royal saudi navy released footage of an operation in the hanish islands which belong to yemen  the original video is now unavailable and the navy’s official social media accounts and website have been taken down although the footage was also uploaded by other unofficial social media channels the video bears the official logo of the royal saudi navy and is consistent with the official material shared by the navy with the international press it can be viewed below  the hanish islands are strategically located in the red sea midway between the coasts of yemen and eritrea close to the bab almandab strait as reported by reuters and aljazeera saudi forces took control of the islands because they along with their coalition partners believed they were being used by houthi rebels to “store and smuggle weapons into yemen” the same media channels quoting local testimonies stated that “the islands had been under heavy shelling by arab forces for weeks before they were seized”  the footage released by the royal saudi navy begins with shells being fired by one of the vessels participating in the operation towards a territory that appears to be the southern tip of jazirat al hanish al kabir the southernmost of the two main islands of the hanish archipelago the lowest point in elevation between the two visible peaks corresponds to this location 13676097 42684568  image top a still from royal saudi navy footage released on december 10 2015 bottom a screen grab from google earth the footage then shows saudi military personnel on a military support ship by the outlines it appears to be one of the two boraidaclass replenishment ships in service with the royal saudi navy a photographic comparison of the vessel can be made with this image posted to shipsspottingcom  image a still from royal saudi navy footage released on december 10 2015 two of the men aboard the vessel appear to be carrying sniper rifles slung across their backs these appear to be of the same model due to the similarities between the muzzle brakes of their rifles which look pointed and with cuts that would appear to match  image a still from royal saudi navy footage released on december 10 2015 these twoports muzzle brakes appear strikingly similar to the ones used on accuracy international’s aw series sniper rifles as shown in this video by forgotten weapons’ specialist ian mccollum  again though this similarity does not represent conclusive evidence that these are the ai weapons especially since most of the rifles are not visible but the video continues  images top left and centre stills from royal saudi navy footage released on december 10 2015 images top right and bottom stills from a video on forgottenweaponscom next the footage shows rigid hull inflatable boats rhibs of the support ship transporting military personnel towards one of the islands at this point an as 365 dauphin helicopter which has possibly embarked from one of the ships participating in the operation is seen surveying the area an assortment of buildings are visible in this section of the video again the area filmed during the flyover appears to correspond to the centralwestern coast of jazirat al hanish al kabir the same portion that appears to be fired upon by a vessel in the initial seconds of the video most of the visible buildings bear significant damage possibly due to the naval bombing yet these structures provide assistance in geolocation of the military activity which will later help us locate ai rifles in the possession of saudi forces building a in blue is located here 13702055 42703930 building b in green is located here 13703113 42704056     image top still from

2015 bottom screen grab from google earth once the group walks into the town the viewer is witness to widespread damage to buildings and vehicles in one of the last scenes the camera focuses on a rifle on the floor alongside a group of saudi soldiers and yemeni captives the visible section of the weapon corresponding to the barrel and forward part of the chassis is consistent with an ai arctic warfare series model sniper rifle  image top still from royal saudi navy footage released on december 10 2015 bottom stills from a video on forgottenweaponscom the bottom image has been horizontally flipped the navy is not the only branch of the saudi military that appears to be equipped with accuracy international rifles  footage posted on the official instagram account below of the saudi special emergency force sef shows a sniper training session held for personnel of the saudi royal guard regiment – a detail which is additionally specified in the post captions this session filmed in these videos and released in september 2019 was held at a training facility in riyadh according to the accompanying captions  image stills from instagram clips of saudi special emergency force sef training sources here and here  these shooters are operating the accuracy international ax308 model with ataics instead of the axaics chassis which usually goes with the ax308 model an archived brochure details the weapon and can be seen here for additional reference an example of the ai chassis system meanwhile can be seen here  image a screen grab taken from a webbrochure displaying accuracy international chassis systems conclusion what seems apparent from our research is that ukmade sniper rifles from accuracy international are in the hands of saudi forces some of whom have operated in yemen  it has also been possible to find export licenses for sniper rifles the uk has granted after the start of the conflict there including to the saudi navy these licenses however do not name the manufacturer or the specific items that were approved for sale saudi arabia has been widely criticised for its role in the yemen conflict and human rights groups have accused it of reckless and indiscriminate attacks on civilians  whether the uk should have granted licenses for the sale of sniper rifles after saudi arabia became involved in yemen given its commitments and rules on arms control – which include taking caution in granting licenses for sale to countries where human rights abuses have been established – would also appear to be a pertinent question and call into doubt uk claims of a “strict” export licensing criteria it seems similarly relevant to ponder if and when accuracy international sniper rifles were approved for sale to buyers in saudi arabia in order to discover how these weapons ended up on the field of battle in yemen from turkey to syria uk sniper rifle sales to turkey have rapidly increased in recent years  according to the un register for conventional arms unroca the uk exported just five sniper rifles to turkey in 2009 and six in 2012 by 2016 however that number had increased to 52 according to att data in 2018 att figures showed that the uk had exported 102 sniper rifles to turkey separate data submitted by turkey to the unroca stated that turkey acquired fifty 338 accuracy octagon sniper rifles from the uk in the same year the “338” mentioned refers to the lapua magnum ammunition that most accuracy international rifles employ the axmc the awm and other non aimanufactured longrange sniper rifles  and while “octagon” does not appear to indicate a particular rifle model among ai’s range it may be a direct translation of the turkish denomination or reference to the forend component of the currentlymarketed ai rifles models  image a brochure details the ai forend mounting system source here further data collected by campaign against the arms trade caat from uk strategic export controls reports shows that the uk has granted 13 licenses for the sale of sniper rifles to turkey since 2008 of these 11 were standard licenses siels and two were open licenses oiels  an oiel granted in october 2016 permitted the unlimited sale of sniper rifles amongst other things to a number of countries including turkey the end use was specified as ‘for accessories  spare parts armed forces end use’ a second oiel was granted in december 2016 for the temporary sale of sniper rifles amongst other things to a separate list of countries which included turkey the end use of this license was specified as ‘for accessories  spare parts civilian  commercial end use’ the enduser notes for the remaining 11 siels are as follows  through data provided in response to freedom of information requests by caat we know that ai applied for a license to sell ml1a items small arms – weapons to turkey twice between september 2007 and december 2015 given the foi request was submitted in 2016 it is possible that ai applied for more licenses to sell ml1a items after these dates yet due to paucity of the data in the siel and oitcl end notes it is not possible to say which if any of the approved licenses were awarded to accuracy international again we sought to see if we could find the weapons being used by turkish troops in live operations we were aware however that some lookalike sniper rifles are also made in turkey turkish company kale defence manufactures a copy of the accuracy international ax50 rifle model it is showcased here in the 2019 turkish defence industry product catalogue and recently entered the inventory of the tsk  image a comparisson between the kale ksr50 top and the accuracy international ax50 bottom yet despite these similarities we were able find some turkish soldiers were equipped with ai rifles an example can be seen here and compared to the screen grab below taken from the forgotten weapons youtube channel   more images of turkish forces bearing ai rifles were filed in a report for turkish state news agency anadolu in one image it is possible to have a closer look at the rifle’s scope which bears a capital “ai” in white this is consistent with the scopes that equip ai rifles according to the caption accompanying the anadolu images the picture of the sniper was taken on february 15 2018 in afrin syria the sniper was reportedly a member of the turkish special forces that supported ‘operation olive branch’ – a controversial turkish military campaign in the north of syria   a video published by anadolu shows the sniper at the same location in the film his rifle can be seen up close of particular interest is the upper receiver’s left side where the manufacturing company and country of origin of the rifle is carved this is a feature of this model of ai rifles “accuracy international england” it appears to read  image a screen grab from anadolu news report the same markings appear visible in the forgotten weapons youtube video that reviews the gun   image screen grabs from the forgotten weapons youtube channel top and bottom in order to further confirm that ukmade sniper rifles were being used by turkish forces in syria we can use the anadolu video to geolocate the sniper’s position one clip shows the sniper looking out over a valley below his position given the photo caption helpfully stating it was taken in afrin syria this allows us to narrow down our search area we can geolocate the sniper’s position to this location 36636722 37031444 within syrian territory   image top a screen grab from an anadolu news report bottom a composite image from google earth showing the same location the afrin mission of early 2018 detailed in the images above was widely condemned human rights watch hrw criticised turkey for having “failed to take necessary precautions to avoid civilian casualties” in several instances during the offensive  yet siel data appears to show that the uk granted export licenses for sniper rifles later that year conclusion our investigation shows that the sale of ukmade sniper rifles to turkey have been increasing in recent years and have continued after the much criticised afrin offensive  given the lack of clarity on export end use notes however it is not possible to conclusively state whether rifles sold after the afrin offensive had begun were for military purposes the siel end notes also do not name the manufacturer or the specific items which were approved for sale yet questions remain on whether it was responsible to approve such licenses under the circumstances and the uk’s stated commitment to responsible arms sales it seems similarly relevant to ponder if and when accuracy international sniper rifles were approved for sale to buyers in turkey in order to help discover how these weapons ended up in the hands of turkish troops on the field of battle in syria again the uk has commitments and rules on arms exports which include taking caution in granting licenses for sale to countries where human rights abuses have been established the russia connection exactly if and when accuracy international began to sell its sniper rifles to russian buyers is unclear however the ai rifle was being used by russian forces as early as 2004 this is evidenced by photos taken by the photographer dmitri beliakov that show the weapons in the hands of a russian sniper at the beslan school siege five years later thenpresident of russia dmitri medvedev was photographed using the rifle with the 7th airborne assault division at the rayevsky firing range in novorossiysk this army division had previously seen a large amount of combat in chechnya in 2010 russian snipers – most likely members of the federal guard service of the russian federation – were photographed with ai rifles on the walls of the kremlin during a victory day parade rehearsal  data collected by campaign against the arms trade caat from the uk strategic export controls show that the uk had granted 18 standard issue export licenses permitting the sale of 191 sniper rifles to russia since 2008 although some of these sales appear to later have been impacted by the 2014 eu arms embargo on russia  according to the un register for conventional arms the uk exported 32 sniper rifles in 2011 15 in 2009 and 10 in 2008 furthermore according to the uk strategic export control report of 2013 the uk exported 106 sniper rifles to the russian federation in 2012 yet the eu arms embargo imposed on 31 july 2014 in response to russian aggression against ukraine meant that as of september 2014 the sections of six standard issue export licenses that permitted the sale of sniper rifles were revoked this meant that the total number of sniper rifles permitted for sale from the uk to russia and recorded in between 2008 and 2014 was halted at 109 the footnotes on the licenses granted for 44 of these sniper rifles list them as for “sporting and hunting end use” while 14 are listed as for “personal use” there is no information available about the enduser for the remaining 51 and interestingly no mention of any end military use thanks to a freedom of information request by caat we know that ai applied for a license to sell ml1a small arms weapons and pl5017 equipment and test models items to russia in 2014 given that no licenses have been approved for the sale of sniper rifles to russia since 2013 it is reasonable to assume that this application was refused   despite all this ai rifles appear to still be being used in russian military operations given we were able to find the rifles being used in conflicts and incidents after 2014 again these weapons were likely purchased before the 2014 embargo was introduced first we spotted an accuracy international rifle being used by russian troops in the republic of dagestan in 2015 during the remnants of an insurgency there a campaign that hrw said was accompanied by repression  the rifle was being used during a battle with insurgents near the village of gimry in dagestan as is evident in a video of the assault two alleged militants locals and a russian soldier were reportedly killed in the shootout on the 23rd of junethe approximate location of the sniper nest used during the operation can be geolocated to a hillside overlooking the road and valley in one still from the video the telephone poles and barriers on the side of the road  can be matched to satellite imagery in another wide shot of the valley the location of an urban area and curvature of rock formations offer further corroboration that the video was indeed shot here 42748962 46844824 outside gimry   image top a still from a video of a firefight filmed near gimry in dagestan russia that shows a sniper with an accuracy international rifle shortly after a bullet was fired bottom a maxar satellite image showing the same location     image top a still from the video that shows the sniper unit and a wide shot of the gimry valley bottom google earth images showing the same location we also found video reports from russian media that the fsb russian security services employed an accuracy international axpattern rifle during a 2017 antiterrorism exersice in annexedcrimea as visible in the foreground below the exercise occurred from may 24 to may 29 2017 crimea was annexed by russia in 2014 but is still internationally recognised as part of ukraine  image an axpattern rifle being used during the fsb counterterrorism exercise in crimea clear distinguishing features on the rifle include the placement of the rivets receiver shape stock hand guard in addition to the shape size and placement of lightning cuts the still was taken from a post on the vk social network that shows the exercise another version of the video can be viewed on facebook this was not the last time russian forces were spotted with an accuracy international rifle in russianoccupied ukraine in may this year the ukrainian army released footage of a sniper unit on the side of the separatists and russian occupation forces in the donbass region of eastern ukraine with what they claimed was an accuracy international rifle they presented this footage along with satellite imagery showing that the footage could be geolocated to the frontline village of donetskyi in the russiancontrolled part of the luhansk oblast of ukraine according to the ukrainian army the platoon was an fsb unit that was responsible for the death of one ukrainian soldier – namely 47yearold vladimir fedchenko who was reportedly killed by a sniper’s bullet on 27 february 2020 near novotoshkivske a village opposite of donetskyi on the ukrainian side of the frontline we were able to confirm that the footage was indeed recorded on the outskirts of the village of donetskyi as the platoon can be seen walking through the garden of this house having obtained five hd videos of this footage we were also able to confirm that the rifle in this video indeed concerns an accuracy international model more specifically one that belongs to the axseries  image the handguard presence of certain groves and locking mechanisms on the buttstock in combination with the keyhole pattern near the barrel shows that this is an accuracy international axpattern rifle still taken from this video using facial recognition search we were also able to identify one of the platoon members in this video as a man who had been posting photos of himself serving in the prizrak brigade – an infantry unit of the separatists of the socalled luhansk people’s republic – on his vk profile since 2015 on this profile he has the name vitaly petrov and is described as living in moscow many of the people in his friends list either reside in russia or in separatistheld territory in eastern ukraine we have been unable to identify the other members in the platoon and have therefore been unable to check whether they served with the fsb or the russian armed forces   image in this frame the rifle is also in good view on the right is vitaly petrov still taken from this video  vitaly petrov front right in a group photo with other separatist militants from his vk profile found via facial recognition website findcloneru since we found no information that the accuracy international rifle was ever sold to ukraine the most obvious explanation is that this rifle came from russia  the transfer of sniper rifles by russia would also be in line with a plethora of evidence relating to the transfer of weapons and manpower across the border into ukraine that bellingcat has gathered over the years conclusion while our research documents british made ai rifles being used by russian snipers over a number of years we found no indication of arms embargo breaches or that licenses had been granted after russia’s intervention in ukraine  nevertheless the fact that the uk allowed the sale of these weapons to russia before 2014 can also be seen as controversial given russia had been accused of human rights violations going back to the chechen war and the insurgency in the north caucasus that followed this also includes accusations by human rights groups that russian marksmen had shot and killed multiple civilians using sniper rifles during the second chechen war again the uk is obliged to ensure caution is taken in granting licenses for sale to countries where human rights abuses have been established  our research also discovered incidents of accuracy international sniper rifles being used in russia and by russianprorussian forces in neighbouring ukraine after the 2014 embargo the quality and durability of the rifles however likely means they were acquired prior to the eu arms embargo in 2014 response both the uk government and accuracy international were contacted as part of the uk arms project  accuracy international did not respond before publication a spokesperson for the uk government said “the uk operates one of the most comprehensive export control regimes in the world  “the government takes its export responsibilities seriously and rigorously assesses all export licences in accordance with strict licensing criteria we will not issue any export licences where to do so would be inconsistent with these criteria  “the government also supports responsible defence and security industries which make an important contribution to the uk’s global economic competitiveness as well as sustaining tens of thousands highly skilled manufacturing and engineeringbased jobs across the uk” your donation to bellingcat is a direct contribution to our

the united states to act as                          in august the united states decided to cut its foreign aid to ethiopia during a period of unprecedented crisis for the region affecting up to 130 million in funds construction continues on africa’s largest hydroelectric dam the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd on the blue nile river with negotiations between egypt ethiopia and sudan at a standstill despite us mediation since november 2019 the countries haven’t reached an agreement over the dam—leading the united states to penalize ethiopia east africa is already facing a triple challenge this year the coronavirus pandemic a plague of desert locusts and flooding that has affected more than 13 million people ethiopia has recorded more than 110554 cases of covid19 and 1709 deaths as of dec 2 the locust swarms which began in yemen and have reached ethiopia kenya and somalia are likely to cause a regional food security crisis that compounds the effects of the pandemic the world bank estimates that the swarms could cost 85 billion in east africa and yemen this year in ethiopia alone the locusts have damaged 200000 hectares of crops and in recent weeks internal conflict has flared in ethiopia where a militia attack on military bases in the tigray region on nov 4 pushed the federal government to respond with force unless ethiopia manages the conflict it could create a regional crisis throughout the horn of africa amid these challenges the longstanding debate over the construction of the gerd remains unresolved the us aid cuts to ethiopia will not help the current negotiations but will instead complicate the talks the united states didn’t take the same harsh approach toward egypt which will affect its perceived role as a neutral mediator the move could increase tensions and disrupt the ongoing negotiations with egypt and sudan over the filling and operation of the dam experts and some us lawmakers have suggested that suspending aid didn’t take into consideration current conditions in the region since the gerd is an ethiopianfinanced project aid cuts at a critical moment when the country already faces multiple challenges will significantly affect the people of ethiopia given more than threequarters of the dam is already complete ethiopia egypt and sudan should return to the table to pursue a longterm watersharing agreement a discussion that prepares for challenges down the road including climate changeinduced shocks can put the ongoing talks back on track the blue nile is a tributary that begins in ethiopia but supplies 85 percent of the water that flows into the nile river which passes through 11 riparian countries despite ethiopia’s plans to build a hydroelectric dam on the blue nile since the 1960s colonialera water treaties left longstanding debates with egypt and sudan which lie downstream established in 1963 the organization of african unity—the african union’s predecessor—rejected most colonialera agreements and ethiopia and the other upstream countries refuse to recognize watersharing treaties between egypt and sudan signed in 1929 and 1959 as a result in 1999 the riparian countries established an intergovernmental partnership the nile basin initiative and signed an agreement for sustainable and equitable use of the river egypt and sudan were part of the initiative and eritrea participated as an observer following up on the 1999 agreement ethiopia began construction on the massive 46 billion gerd project in 2011 progress in the gerd negotiations has been slow but there is promise in 2015 the leaders of egypt ethiopia and sudan met in khartoum and signed a declaration of principles agreement that supplanted the colonialera water treaties that had given egypt an upper hand over other riparian countries the dam is a national project and a source of pride for millions of ethiopians and the ethiopian government argues that it will not significantly reduce the flow of the nile expected to produce 6000 megawatts of electricity upon completion the gerd aims to fulfill the demands of the 55 percent of ethiopia’s population that currently lacks access to electricity it will also help reduce poverty and boost businesses enterprises across ethiopia incur up to 15 percent of production costs due to power outages instead of helping mediate the dispute the us decision to withhold aid to ethiopia could disrupt the ongoing discussions in february ethiopia walked away from the last round of usmediated talks in washington the african union which is currently involved in negotiations has embraced principle of “african solutions for african problems” which seeks to prevent external interference in disputes and conflicts since delaying the completion of the dam would lead to huge additional costs ethiopia has kept up construction the first stage of filling the dam’s reservoir was conducted in july and it will continue over the next five to seven years until the dam reserve stores 74 billion cubic meters of water read more biden should learn from carter and head off further conflict while he still can  as long as the renaissance dam remains an instrument in ethiopia’s bid to control the blue nile negotiations are doomed the gerd is expected to significantly improve the livelihood of millions throughout the region ethiopia plans to supply affordable electric power to the neighboring countries including djibouti and sudan ethiopia egypt sudan and the other parties involved in mediation should take five key actions to facilitate a winwin outcome in the current negotiations first the three countries and other stakeholders must recognize that sharing nile water resources is not a zerosum game it can result in a winwin situation this basic principle undermines egypt and sudan’s colonialera water treaties which excluded upstream countries without their consent in both the 1929 angloegyptian treaty and the 1959 united kingdom and independent egypt treaties the upstream riparian countries did not participate second the united states must remain neutral in the mediation process or risk losing credibility as an honest broker in a phone conversation with sudan and israel’s leaders in october us president donald trump said that egypt might “blow up” the dam if an agreement is not reached over its operation former us ambassador to ethiopia david shinn said that the trump administration was “putting its thumb on the scale in favor of egypt” ethiopia’s foreign minister has called the united states “undiplomatic” in its effort to resolve the gerd dispute third other countries’ experiences with a transboundary river such as the colorado river basin in the united states and mexico could help to resolve concerns about the management and operation of the gerd these experiences could complement the advice of experts’ groups formed by ethiopia egypt and sudan to analyze the prospects of a major drought and how to address it following a scientific approach and promoting the development of groundwater resources in egypt could assuage the fears of the occurrence of drought fourth science diplomacy and collaboration will be important to mitigate the risks and improve resilience to multiple and overlapping shocks such as the coronavirus pandemic desert locusts and flooding the united states should provide additional support to facilitate a longlasting solution not cut off aid at a critical time since july more than 300000 people have been displaced by flooding in ethiopia exposing them to malaria and waterborne diseases more likely to affect vulnerable groups such as women and children finally given the importance of us aid to ethiopia’s economy cutting it off as the country faces multiple daunting challenges is unwise it will negatively affect the us government’s image in ethiopia increase tensions and undermine the perception of us neutrality in the gerd negotiations above all managing the gerd dispute will not only help egypt ethiopia and sudan but also the entire east african region ethiopia is too big to fail if it does the entire region will be dragged down with it the african union has begun a conflict resolution discussion with the ethiopian government over the tigray conflict in collaboration with the united nations likewise the african unionled talks on the gerd dispute should be scaled up to reach an agreement on the filling and operation of the dam there is no peaceful way to resolve an issue such as the gerd dispute other than diplomacy and collaboration egypt ethiopia and sudan have a long history of diplomatic relations with the united states and look forward to working with the incoming biden administration—which should serve as a truly neutral broker—when it takes office in january 2021 governing the nile river water with a new transboundary cooperative framework can accommodate the interest of both upstream and downstream countries on sharing the nile river rather than relying on the controversial colonialera treaties in this case all three countries as well as stakeholders in the negotiations would be winners tigist mekonnen melesse is a former development economist with

105,key points background founded in 2019 by former members of the now defunct traditionalist worker party the legion of saint ambrose aka christ gang is a small white supremacist group based in knoxville tennessee using themes from christianity to justify its white supremacist beliefs the legion seeks to rebuild america as a white christian nation claiming that america was “forged founded and preserved by european christians” legion members intend to “preserve and enforce” the culture principles and morals that they claim are associated with america’s founding fathers and traditional christians “we recognize that our nation was forged founded and preserved by european christians thus we embrace the european roots of our nation and people and seek to preserve and enforce the culture principals sic and morals of our ancestors and faith”  legion of st ambrose website april 5 2019 “the legion of st ambrose was established in 2019 to help rebuild our nation around the word of god and sacred tradition”  legion of st ambrose twitter march 2019 saint aurelius ambrose the group’s namesake was an influential religious figure in the late fourth century who fought for the supremacy of the catholic church over the roman emperor this emphasis on church supremacy by ambrose is used by the legion for part of its platform which calls for a christian state religion the legion also appears to be influenced by romanian corneliu zelea codreanu a fascist politician who founded the iron guard an extremeright political party in romania in the interwar period codreanu promoted antisemitism and advocated for the elimination of jews from romania the iron guard also known as the legion of the archangel michael massacred tens of thousands romanian jews in the 1930s and during the holocaust like the legion the ideology of the iron guard included strong elements of orthodox christianity several legion members and supporters have made references to codreanu and used his quotes on social media exploiting early christian writings in its rhetoric and propaganda and to justify its own extreme beliefs the legion utilizes language lifted—often out of context—from the writings of various early christian religious figures and christian orthodox theologians for example in april 2019 legion members met in waynesville north carolina for a book burning destroying books they termed “degenerate” on subjects such as homosexuality feminism communism and pagan religions to justify the book burning  the legion posted a quote from saint constantine during the socalled arian controversy of the fourth century in which constantine urged that the writings of arius whose theological views differed from his own be burned the arian controversy however has nothing to do with the topics hated by the legion members they simply used the quote to justify their own extreme actions similarly the legion used a quote condemning lust from st john chrysostom to justify its opposition to the university of tennesseeknoxville’s annual sex week which provides students with opportunities to discuss subjects such as sexual assault the intersection of faith and sexuality mental health and sex and other topics related to sex and sexuality and at a demonstration against planned parenthood in march 2019 legion members created a banner invoking st clement of alexandria an early church figure who opposed abortion membership members and supporters of the legion are former members of the traditionalist worker party twp which was led by matthew heimbach as twp’s leader

56,perspectives november 20 2020  presidentelect biden has pledged to make support for democracy a centerpiece of his foreign policy by supporting moldova’s breakthrough he would start to make good on his promise senior program officer for europe and eurasia ginayogina  last sunday’s elections in moldova are something to celebrate — locally regionally and internationally voter turnout hit record levels particularly among the diaspora maia sandu pas party triumphed by a landslide in the runoffs with 57 percent of the vote over the incumbent president igor dodon socialist party sandu will be the country’s first woman president  according to local and international observation missions these elections were generally free and fair — remarkable progress for a country that struggled with electoral fraud for the last five years pavel postica from promolex a moldovan ngo that specializes in human rights defense and election monitoring said that sandu’s victory was as a surprise triumphing “against all obstacles” given that there are still notable shortcomings in moldova’s electoral processes sandu ran on the promise of shepherding through reforms to address the entrenched institutional corruption that had worsened under dodon’s rule the impunity enjoyed by those implicated in the outrageous “stolen billion” case from 2014 underscored the extent to which oligarchs and shadowy political figures used the courts and the captured state as a tool to protect their interests alina radu editorinchief of ziarul de garda the country’s main daily newspaper said that given that moldova is a parliamentary democracy with checks and balances governmental ability to curb corruption may prove insufficient “but sandu is there as a symbol of integrity” she said “and other political figures must accept that such a person was elected by the people” sandu has also prioritized releasing the government’s longstanding chokehold over the free press according to freedom house’s most recent freedom in the world report on moldova the media environment continues to be dominated by outlets connected to political parties and journalists from opposition and independent media are frequently denied access to information and entry to government institutions the covid19 pandemic exacerbated these existing issues journalists’ access to information of public interest was an early target of moldova’s pandemicrelated restrictions where dodon and other politicians allowed selective access to press conferences provided conflicting information and did not allow journalists to ask questions this created a dire situation as of november there are over 90000 confirmed coronavirus cases and over 2000 deaths a significant number given that moldova is a country of about 35 million people  with sandu’s victory civil society in moldova has high expectations that moldovas democratic reform efforts will finally be realized many were disappointed in 2019 after sandu’s bloc formed a shortlived coalition government with the socialists there was no time for sandu to begin to realize her vision for reforms before acrimony and deadlock resulted in the coalition’s dissolution last november today however the mood feels different “maia sandu’s victory demonstrates that society has high expectations about eliminating corruption and oligarchic influence in moldova” said ana indoitu leader of invento a youth activism ngo  sandu has a track record of closely engaging civil society actors in developing policies during her shortlived tenure as prime minister she included media ngos and watchdog groups in the process to improve moldova’s weak media legislation and regulatory framework and many civil society actors joined her government during her brief tenure as prime minister many are likely to join her cabinet this time as well despite the enthusiasm civil society knows it needs to continue to play its role in holding the government accountable and encouraging its progress postica underscored this point “as representatives of civil society we have always put the public interest first it doesnt matter who holds power or who is in charge of a public institution we have to keep the same universal approach” indoitu added “civil society must remain vigilant even though sandu is keen on cooperation with civic actors in this new context meaningful partnership can set the baseline for reform however watchdog activities on the part of civil society are key” such evenhandedness however belies the reality of the challenge ahead sandu will face determined challenges in trying to pass her reform agenda in a parliament where the socialist party currently holds the majority many of her opponents stand to lose out in a big way should the reformers succeed in implementing an ambitious anticorruption agenda this is an existential fight the international community particularly the united states must not ignore what is at stake as presidentelect joe biden takes office on january 20 2021 he will have many demands on his attention he and his team should note that the success of a country like moldova can have a major impact on its neighbors biden promised to restore the united states reputation as a democratic world leader and reliable partner for its allies in europe encouraging and supporting moldova will demonstrate that

262,in a true day to remember for the couple but perhaps not for the reasons they had hoped a 55person wedding in a small town in maine ended up giving half the guests covid19 leading to a coronavirus outbreak involving 177 people killing 7 of them the cdc report on the huge outbreak  published today details how one attendee who reported covid19 symptoms the day after the wedding led to 27 out of 55 wedding attendees eventually being diagnosed with the virus plus 3 other cases at the venue including staff the index or first case is thought to be a person who attended the wedding on august 7th before reporting covid19 symptoms the next day at the time of the wedding maine had a 50 person limit for such events and guests reportedly did not wear masks nor observe physical distancing rules temperature checks were done on guests at the entrance of the venue but considering many people with covid19 do not report having a fever these are considered to be of very limited use for screening  it has also been suggested that they may do more harm than good by giving people a false sense of security thus causing them to be less careful with other protective measures like masking and physical distancing in a poignant display of how much damage selfishly ignoring safety guidelines can do the outbreak spread much further with 27 additional cases in the local community including two at a school which then had to shut completely for two weeks but this was only the very start of the damage one of the wedding guests visited a parent in the days after the ceremony the parent was a healthcare worker at a longterm care facility and a few days after that interaction became sick with covid19 symptoms despite experiencing symptoms the person worked at the care home for two days before seeking a covid19 test this led to an outbreak of 38 cases among staff and residents were reported at the longterm care facility over 100 miles away from the wedding six of these people eventually died none had attended the wedding more for you pfizer’s covid19 vaccine results look exciting—but come with big warnings this nasal spray could be the breakthrough we need to end covid19 study trump rallies linked to over 700 covid19 coronavirus deaths here are the caveats another wedding guest worked at a correctional facility around 200 miles away from the wedding this guest reported symptoms of covid19 one week after attending the ceremony despite this they worked daily 8hour shifts in two separate correctional facility units while symptomatic this case led to 18 additional cases in staff members and 48 inmates at the facility 16 additional household contacts of staff members were also sickened no deaths were reported from this part of the outbreak remarkably a list of guests at the wedding was either not made or was not made available to the authorities tracing the outbreak with the report stating that the maine cdc “likely undercounted cases of illness that were linked to the event and the attack rate for the reception guests is thus a conservative estimate” the report concludes “community gatherings such as weddings birthday parties church events and funerals have the potential to be sarscov2 superspreading events 1–3 increased transmission risk at such events might result from failure to maintain physical distancing and inconsistent use of masks transmission risk is further increased when events are held indoors” weddings have been frequent facilitators of covid19 superspreader events one ceremony near toronto in canada resulted in at least 44 cases even in new zealand which has managed to crush it’s covid19 pandemic a march wedding caused an outbreak of 98 cases  just a few weeks ago new york authorities managed to block a wedding that supposedly would have had around 10000 guests 200 times larger than the maximum gathering limit in the city at that time so if you were hoping to get married this year it might be better to have an exceptionally small ceremony while observing safety rules or perhaps postpone bigger events until a time when covid19 is not so out of control or you could risk your day being memorable for all of

191,the international criminal court icc has authorised an investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity occurring in afghanistan since 2003 by the taleban and united states and afghan government forces the investigation will also cover crimes related to the afghan conflict that took place on the territory of other icc member states thereby bringing the possibility for justice for those rendered by the cia to black sites in poland lithuania and romania and allegedly tortured the court decision reversed an earlier rejection for an investigation by the pretrial chamber of the icc and ignored pleas not to investigate by the afghan government and threats by the united states aan’s ehsan qaane and kate clark have been looking at what the court’s ruling might mean for the victims of afghanistan’s war and for any future peace talks  a boy looks on at a house damaged in an assault on amrullah salehs election campaign office in kabul on 29 july 2019 the attack killed 20 people and injured 50 photo noorullah shirzadaafp despite the best efforts of the afghan and american governments and opposition within some quarters of the court the icc has finally agreed to move ahead with an investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity in afghanistan the decision comes 13 years after icc chief prosecutor fatou bensouda began her preliminary examination of the ‘afghanistan situation’ more than two years since she recommended the pretrial chamber authorise an investigation and 10 months after it decided against an investigation the decision by the five judges of the icc’s appeal chamber was unanimous that an investigation should go ahead read their decision here and the press release from the court here   last year the three judges of the pretrial chamber had rejected a request to investigate arguing this would not be in the ‘interests of justice’ although they agreed with bensouda’s preliminary examination that war crimes and crimes against humanity had taken place were grave enough and of a scale to merit the court’s attention and that domestic courts had been either unwilling or unable to take action both the prosecutor and different groups of victims’ legal representatives appealed against this judgement 1 and the appeals chamber met to hear their arguments and those supporting the pretrial chamber’s decision in december 2019 now in the words of the icc press release it has decided that  …the pretrial chamber should have addressed only whether there was a reasonable factual basis for the prosecutor to proceed with an investigation in the sense of whether crimes have been committed and whether the potential cases arising from such investigation would appear to fall within the court’s jurisdiction   furthermore the appeal judges noted that the pretrial chamber’s decision had contained “all the necessary factual findings” and confirmed that there was “a reasonable basis to consider that crimes within the icc jurisdiction have been committed in afghanistan” it has therefore decided not to send the matter back to the pretrial chamber for a fresh decision but to itself authorise the opening of an investigation    the judges’ decision focuses on the alleged crimes that have taken place not the alleged perpetrators however in her preliminary examination bensouda named the taleban for a range of crimes including murder and deliberately attacking civilians and the cia and us military and the afghan national security force ansf for torture 2 the 695 submissions to the court on behalf of thousands of victims in december 2017january 2018 individually or in sometimes very large groups analysis here and here testified to an even greater range of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity mentioning  murder attempted murder imprisonment or other severe deprivation of liberty torture rape sexual violence persecution enforced disappearance of persons other inhumane acts attack against civilian population attack against protected objects destruction of property pillage forced displacement outrages upon personal dignity and denying a fair trial  the court has now authorised not only the investigation of alleged crimes committed on afghan territory as well as alleged crimes which had a nexus to the afghanistan conflict this brings into the purview of the court the alleged rendition and torture of afghans and others by the cia to black sites in third countries – here the date of jurisdiction of the court is earlier – 1 july 2002 when they became members of the court as opposed to 1 may 2003 when afghanistan became a member such third countries mentioned previously by bensouda are poland lithuania and romania katherine gallagher lawyers for a group of alleged victims of the cia also mentioned in a tweet djibouti and jordan calling on any member state which had “cooperated with the us in running its global torture program” to now cooperate with the prosecution in “quickly advancing” the investigation  implications of the decision to investigate  the appeal court’s judgement has many implications firstly of course for afghans and other victims of war crimes who have yet to see their alleged perpetrators put on trial the icc report into victims’ views see aan analysis here found that  overwhelmingly they wanted an investigation – 98 per cent of those who made submissions the court said they  … emphasized their longing for justice which also characterizes many sectors of society and their belief that peace in afghanistan can only be achieved through justice they reported that this belief was their driving force redacted  chair of the afghanistan independent human rights commission aihrc shahrzad akbar tweeted her “gratitude to victims who submitted testimonies  brave afg organizations  activists who advocated fearlessly  tirelessly for this outcome” she said the court’s judgement promised “justice” to the victims of war and was “welcome news” for afghanistan   the afghan government however will be dismayed by the judgement caught between its legal duty as an icc member to cooperate with the investigation and the wrath of its main supporter the united states if it does so it will have to tread a difficult and tricky path the afghan ambassador to the hague homayun azizi had already said that afghanistan would use article 18 of the rome statute to challenge the admissibility of particular cases the prosecutor he told aan would then have to stop her investigation and have a monitoring position and could only intervene in those cases if she proved they were not being genuinely prosecuted icc spokesperson fadi el abdullah however told aan that article 18 can only be used when the prosecutor initiates an investigation if kabul was to try such a move it seems it would have to be well down the line and would require them to demonstrate that they had the will and capacity to investigate and prosecute individuals at the highest levels of responsibility something they have so far been unable to do  secondly the court has stood up to us bullying the us is not a member of the icc and has always argued vehemently that its nationals are not bound by its jurisdiction however afghanistan and other states are members and the court therefore does have jurisdiction for alleged war crimes taking place on their soil by anyone of any nationality washington will not be happy with today’s ruling in september 2018 then secretary of state john bolton made a ferocious attack on the court see aan reporting here calling it “ineffective unaccountable and indeed outright dangerous” and alleging its central aim had always been to “constrain the united states” not just “targeting individual us service members but rather america’s senior political leadership and its relentless determination to keep our country secure” in april 2019 the us revoked bensouda’s visa  the court may also just have made itself much more relevant having been criticised for only ‘investigating alleged african perpetrators of war crimes’ it has now decided to embark on an investigation which will partly cover the citizens of a superpower   conclusion the way ahead   the icc ruling has come by chance just days after the us and the taleban signed an agreement which envisages intraafghan peace talks for us secretary of state mike pompeo this made the ruling “all the more reckless… to come just days the united states signed a historic peace deal on afghanistan which is the best chance for peace in a generation” others have found serendipity in the timing human rights watch’s patricia gossman contends that any sustainable peace will need to be underpinned by justice and the icc investigation should be a reminder of that she also commented on how the failings of the posttaleban settlement have blighted the last two decades  …the bonn agreement signed in december 2001 after the defeat of the taliban government failed to provide justice for rights violations by all sides and fuelled further atrocities by allowing serious human rights abusers to maintain official and unofficial positions of power  that decision to deliberately ignore war crimes has meant impunity for perpetrators and continuing instability and conflict in afghanistan this was also a message from some of the victims who made submissions to the court in 2017 and 2018 many of whom spoke of their continuing fear of ‘warlords’ reprisals and the lack of ways to get justice through the afghan courts it was one reason for many to urge the icc to investigate this person for example quoted in the icc’s report on victims’ submissions said many who had not been able to contact the courts needed justice and needed to be remembered   most people in afghanistan and our bereaved families are not highly educated and do not have access to the internet and facilities and just because they have not been able to file or register this form please do not disregard their feelings and do not forget them and listen to them so that the continuation of bloody and painful incidents like this is prevented  however the way ahead now for the court will not be easy or straightforward the us had already threatened economic sanctions not clear if against the court or its personnel if the icc went ahead with an investigation of its nationals and today pompeo promised to take “all necessary measures to protect our citizens from this renegade unlawful socalled court”   moreover an icc investigation is not itself without peril the security threats and restrictions will be challenging particularly given the caution that the court has tended to show when operating in complex security environments the investigation will take many years and will eventually focus in on just a handful of perpetrators some of whom will doubtless try to flout an icc indictment if or when it comes given these hurdles the perceived success of this investigation will depend significantly on the icc’s ability to spend time in afghanistan and communicate its unfamiliar process to afghans in particular the afghan victims of war who are hungry for justice up till now it has been very poor at communicating for now however victims and their supporters are encouraged by the court’s ruling – and all too aware of how bleak the situation would feel if the appeals chamber had ruled the other way   edited by rachel reid  annex chronology of the icc’s engagement in afghanistan  in february 2003 the afghan government deposited its instrument of ratification to the rome statute the establishment document of the icc in 1 may 2003 the afghan government become a state party of the icc in 2007 the office of the prosecutor of the icc began a preliminary investigation into the situation of the afghanistan the aim was to find out if any rome statute crimes were committed related to the ongoing armed conflict of afghanistan since its membership and whether there had been domestic accountability efforts in relation to these crimes  in 2011 for the first time the office of the prosecutor of the icc published its first annual report about the afghanistan situation in its two page report the otp named five types of crimes killings torture attacks on humanitarian targets and the un attacks on protected objects and recruitment of child soldiers criminalised in the rome statute which allegedly occurred in relation to the afghanistan armed conflict in 2016 the otp annual report said that their findings showed there are reasonable based to believed war crimes and crimes against humanity occurred by the taleban and its affiliated the afghan national security forces as well as the us army and its central intelligence service cia the otp said that it would soon make its decision to submit its request of authorisation to open a full investigation into the situation of afghanistan to a pretrial chamber after the publication of this report the afghan government established regular direct communication with the icc the afghan government sent at least three delegations to the hague arguing that while they were willing to investigate war crimes nationally they needed at least another year to build capacity in an attempt to demonstrate willingness the office of the attorney general had set up a war crimes unit and articles from the rome statute were incorporated into afghan law  in november 2017 the icc’s prosecutor submitted her request to authorise an investigation into the afghanistan situation to a pretrial chamber of the icc  after the submission of the prosecutor’s request the us government put political pressure on the icc to not authorise the request their argument was that the icc does not have jurisdiction over the us as the us is not a party to the icc in april 2019 the pretrial chamber ii of the icc rejected the request arguing that there was no reasonable basis to believe the investigation served “the interests of justice” although they accepted that there was a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed in the territory of afghanistan by the taleban the afghan national security forces and the us army and cia as well as in the territory of other state parties including poland romania and lithuania by the us army and cia the chamber also acknowledged that there had not been domestic prosecutions of perpetrators in june 2019 the otp and three victims’ legal representatives appeared before the pretrial chamber to contest their refusal to authorise an investigation they argued that the pretrial chamber had erred in law by attempting to assess “the interests of justice” or to have a positive determination of the interests of justice in december 2019 the appeals chamber of the icc held threeday public hearing where the representatives of the otp victims’ representatives the defence lawyer of the afghan government and some civil society and academia presented their arguments against or in favour of the pretrial chamber on 5 march 2020 the judges of the appeals chamber reversed the pretrial chamber’s decision and authorised a full investigation the appeals chamber in its judgment argued that the pretrial chamber did not have the power to assess the interests of justice 1 only the prosecutor’s appeal was allowed by the appeals chamber but the arguments of victims’ groups were heard by the court as well as representations from those arguing against an investigation including from the afghan government   2 in bensouda’s november 2016 preliminary examination report which we analysed here she wrote that there was a reasonable basis to believe that the taleban and haqqani network have committed war crimes murder intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population humanitarian personnel and protected objects conscripting children and killing or wounding treacherously a combatant adversary – all of which it said “were committed on a large scale and as part of a plan or policy” and crimes against humanity murder imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty and persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political grounds and on gender grounds all “allegedly committed as part of a widespread andor systematic attack…” for the full quote see paragraphs 206 and 207 of the report  the afghan government faces an investigation for the war crimes of torture and cruel treatment outrages upon personal dignity pursuant to article and sexual violence in the 2016 preliminary examination report the otp named the afghan intelligence agency the national directorate of security nds the afghan national police afghan national army afghan national border police and the afghan local police as alleged perpetrators and said it estimated that 35 to 50 per cent of all conflictrelated detainees “may be subjected to torture” carried out in a “state of total impunity”  the 2016 preliminary examination report also named the cia and us military that during interrogations of security detainees and in conduct supporting those interrogations they  … resorted to techniques amounting to the commission of the war crimes of torture cruel treatment outrages upon personal dignity and rape… specifically  members of us armed forces appear to have subjected at least 61 detained persons to torture cruel treatment outrages upon personal dignity on the territory of afghanistan between 1 may 2003 and 31 december 2014 the majority of the abuses are alleged to have occurred in 20032004  members of the cia appear to have subjected at least 27 detained persons to torture cruel treatment outrages upon personal dignity andor rape on the territory of afghanistan and other states parties to the statute namely poland romania and lithuania between december 2002 and march 2008 the majority of the abuses are alleged to have occurred in 20032004  crucially the otp said these “alleged crimes were not the abuses of a few isolated individuals” but rather were part of a policy  the office considers that there is a reasonable basis to believe these alleged crimes were committed in furtherance of a policy or policies aimed at eliciting information through the use of interrogation techniques involving cruel or violent methods which would support us objectives in the

26,november 2520 switzerland replacement armasuisse which is the swiss federal office for defense procurement announced that it has received the second set of proposals for the country’s air2030 neues kampfflugzeug new fighter aircraft nkf as well as groundbased air defense system the offers to replace the swiss air force’s f5ef tiger ii and fa18 hornet fleets were made by germany for airbus eurofighter france for the dassault rafale and the united states for the boeing fa18ef super hornet and lockheed martin f35a lightning joint strike fighter the ddps said the proposals included the prices for 36 and 40 aircraft including logistics and weapons as a binding starting point for negotiations with the winning offer after type selection   the fa18 hornet is the fa18 ef super hornet‘s predecessor with the first models introduced in the late 1970s as a spinoff of the usaf’s yf17 lightweight fighter competitor hornets are currently flown by the us marine corps as their frontline fighter by the us navy as a secondtier fighter behind its larger fa18 ef super hornets and by 7 international customers australia canada finland kuwait malaysia spain and switzerland the usa’s aircraft were expected to have a service life of 20 years but that was based on 100 carrier landings per year the us navy and marines have been rather busy during the hornets’ service life and so the planes are wearing out faster this is forcing the usa to take a number of steps in order to keep their hornets airworthy replacing center barrel sections reopening production lines and more some of these efforts will also be offered to allied air forces who have their own refurbishment and upgrade programs   some of the parts procured under boeing’s contracts will be produced for allied military services who fly the fa18 the hornet was a mcdonnelldouglas aircraft so contracts will generally be to that boeing subsidiary in st louis mo unless otherwise noted note that “center barrel sections” refer to the middle chunk of the plane where the wings joint the body as one might guess replacing them is a somewhat involved process and is also very helpful in extending the airframe’s fatiguehour limits  there are some gaps in this article’s coverage national mro maintenance repair  optimization initiatives don’t get comprehensive coverage beyond the multifleet central contracts announced in the usa though some coverage and links are present there’s also a thin line at times between upgrades required to remain survivable and hence useful in national fleets and airframe lifeextension efforts in theory they’re different but in practice they’re often linked as such leaving all upgrades out would do readers a disservice so they occasionally appear when there’s a connection again however lists of upgrades are not comprehensive note that hornet fighters use different radars raytheon’s apg65 is installed aboard usn and usmc fa18cd hornets both radar types and the usmc’s av8b harrier ii plus vstol fighters abroad it serves in av8bs operated by spain and italy in spain’s “ef18abs” and kuwait’s fa18cds and in german and greek f4 phantom strike fighters raytheon’s apg73 serves some of the usa’s fa18cd hornet fleet and the usn’s fa18ef block i super hornet apg73 fighters it’s also found in hornets flown by australia fa18ambm canada cf18ambm finland fa18cd malaysia

range endurance and ordnance carriage capabilities comparable to the a6 which have been retired the fa18ef aircraft are 42 feet longer than earlier hornets have a 25 larger wing area and carry 33 more internal fuel which will effectively increase mission range by 41 and endurance by 50 the super hornet also incorporates two additional weapon stations this allows for increased payload flexibility by

equipment the canadian government acquired the 30year old jets in order of filling a capability gap affecting the royal canadian airforce’s ability to simultaneously meet norad and nato obligations originally canada had intended to supplement its fleet of 85 boeing cffa18 ab fighters with 18 new boeing fa18 ef super hornets this plan was cancelled in favor of the australian hornets when boeing accused canada’s bombardier of receiving unfair subsidies from ottawa before the aircraft can be integrated into the canadian fleet of cf188 hornets they will undergo several modifications in mirabel quebec they have to be brought to the same operational configuration as the canadian cf188 hornets this means cockpit and communications upgrades a night vision imaging system a sniper targeting pod landing gear modifications a new ejection seat as well as the air force paint scheme june 2116 pressure is mounting on the pentagon to approve the sale of fa18 super hornets to kuwait though us navy secretary ray mabus has warned that his service will have to pay more to buy the fa18 due to cost increases according to mabus boeing needs more orders so that it can keep producing the fighter at an economical rate as the 16 slated for fiscal year 2017 are not enough to ensure optimum production kuwait has been waiting over a year for approval for 28 fighters in a deal estimated to cost 3 billion june 716 canada looks set to procure an interim fleet of boeing fa18 super hornets to fill a capability gap as it procrastinates on how to proceed with its new fighter competition the liberal party leader justin trudeau promised during the election campaign not to buy the f35 to replace its aging cf18s but the government has been struggling with how to fulfill that promise for fear any attempt to exclude the stealth fighter from a competition will result in a multibilliondollar lawsuit according to one senior defence department official may 1216 software updates for the fa18 and ea18g have

2019 it is expected that the us navy will purchase more fa18s while export orders of the f15 will continue to partner nations the company has recently been implementing a series of cost cutting measures to boost productivity in the wake of losing out on the recent bomber program for the usaf to northrop grumman december 1815 it looks like a very merry christmas for lockheed martin and boeing as they came out as the major winners in the announced 115 trillion spending bill announced on wednesday funding will see eleven more f35 lightning iis than requested by president obama in february the f35 program will see 133 billion additional procurement money as production of the fighters will be ramped up the fa18 production line will also be extended with seven more ea18g growlers and five fa18ef super hornets planned july 2415 boeing is committing to keep its f18 production line open in response to new and forecast orders from both the us and international customers the company was worried that insufficient orders for new super hornet and growler aircraft would fail to materialize and keep the production line economically viable boeing considered slowing the production rate in

fighter deal results in a referendum loss with projections showing about a 534 no vote the only surprise is that the margin was this narrow indicating a winnable vote compare and contrast with the september 2013 referendum which resulted in the swiss keeping conscription or the government’s success in the referendum that ratified their fa18 hornet buy while some governments in europe will rerun referendums until they get the result they like the swiss aren’t like that the tte fighter buy is history but the f5ef fleet will still retire placing more emphasis on their fleet of 30 hornets

contract n0001909c0052 nov 1512 usn life extension the us gao publishes gao1351 “better cost estimates needed for extending the service life of selected f16s and fa18s” the lateness of the f35 and high flighthour usage over iraq and afghanistan are making it hard to keep fighter numbers up current usaf plans involve 261 billion to upgrade at least 300 of 1020 f16s to fly another 2000 hours est 68 years each add more advanced radars etc the usn would spend about 219 billion to keep 150 of 624 fa18ad hornet fighters flying for another 1400 flight hours est 5 years each alongside a separate buy of 41 more fa18ef super hornets the alternative is a more expensive approach that would buy new f16s or super hornets they would cost much more but last 4x5x as long the problem is that the cost of new planes is known but costs of fixing existing aircraft to cover for additional f35 delays or add new capabilities aren’t as clear f16 upgrades could rise to 650 planes and fa18 hornet life extension could rise to 280 planes with the possibility of added capability upgrades the us navy’s 2011 plan for its hornet fleet would take place over fy 20132017 the planes to be upgraded would be specially chosen presumably for low wear and structural integrity they would also be individually evaluated for capability enhancements but those aren’t in the 219 billion budget current estimates involve another 176 million per hornet for capability upgrades and an average of 564 million more if the hornets need structural life extension and obsolescence replacement that gives us a figure of between 219 – 33 billion if 150 hornets are upgraded 146 – 22 million per plane and the upper ends of that figure offer poorer longterm value for money than buying a new super hornet in the mid60 million range if costs are linear the total for a 280 plane program would be between 409 – 616 billion but costs are often not linear hence the gao’s recommendation to do a full sensitivity analysis so decision makers can fully understand the range of navy costs between 219 – 616 billion sept 2812 aging in australia the australian reports that the raaf has been ordered to scale back its usage of its modernized fa18ambm hornets in order to keep them viable until f35 begin arriving in the early 2020s aging is taking a serious toll and 6271 fighters had “structure fatigue above that expected for the airframe hours” meanwhile annual maintenance costs for australia’s hornet fleet were a118 million in 2001 a 170 million in 2012 and is expected to be a 214 million by 2018 the anao sees costs

times article details the efforts underway to keep the us navy’s fleet of fa18 ad hornet fighters in service until some of them can be replaced by f35bc jets the usn’s fa18 program manager capt mark darrah is quoted as saying that the hornet fleet is averaging about 330 flighthours per year which means they’re consistently about 30 above planned usage many have now exceeded even their extended usage figure of 8000 flight hours fortunately their accident rate remains low carrier air wing 7 commander capt roy kelley adds that the fa18ef super hornet fleet is also burning through airframe hours with 73 of the fleet’s 418 aircraft already over 3000 hours – wich is about halfway through their safe design lifetimes the navy hopes to extend its hornet airframes to 10000 safe flight hours up from the easier target of 8600 each plane costs about 15 million when put through the deep inspections and refurbishment program it’s accompanied by detailed recordkeeping and a constant juggling act among the squadrons darrah says that navairnaf’s quarterly modification review “literally makes the decisions every quarter on bureau number by bureau number what aircraft will be assigned to what units” based heavily on flight hour and maintenance issues once on the carrier that juggling continues networking has made flight data files compilable and accessible across the fleet allowing for

183,read the diplomat know the asiapacific the russian presence in central asia predicated on the threats from afghanistan stymies the political and economic development of the region on november 24 2020 russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in a video message to the participants of the geneva international conference on afghanistan expressed moscow’s concern about the ongoing escalation of violence in afghanistan in particular he emphasized that islamic state militants are concentrating forces in the northern provinces of the country in order to create a springboard for further expansion into central asia this statement came following a decision by outgoing us president donald trump to further reduce the number of us troops in the county to 2500 by midjanuary 2021 which may serve to validate the fears of the russian side about a deteriorating security situation at the same time there are factors that cast doubt on moscow’s position which can also be regarded as part of a russian desire to substantiate its foreign policy objectives in the south russian officials have made numerous comments in the past about the growing influence of international terrorist groups in northern afghanistan that moscow says aim to expand their operations into central asia in november 2018 lavrov touched on this topic during a speech at a conference on afghanistan held in moscow and announced that the islamic state contingent in the afghanistan was receiving support from foreign sponsors in order to turn the country into a zone for further advancement in central asia’s direction in january 2019 russian deputy foreign minister igor zubkov also voiced concerns that islamic state militants were grouping together in helicopters and readying an attack toward the tajikistan border that statement was made a few days before a visit by lavrov to dushanbe where he offered additional security assistance to the tajik side despite the weakening of the islamic state’s positions in the middle east and afghanistan it is apparent that statements made by russian officials about the existing threat of the spread of the conflict into central asia are both a reaction to western policy and a desire to make the problem of international terrorism in afghanistan topical in order to maintain moscow’s influence in the region currently russia’s military presence in central asia is limited to the 201st russian military base in dushanbe tajikistan an airbase in kant kyrgyzstan and a torpedotest range on lake issykkul also in kyrgyzstan according to observers this presence allows russia to maintain political influence in central asia and receive information about the combat and operational capabilities of the local armed forces the withdrawal of western coalition forces from afghanistan expands the geostrategic field for the advancement of russia’s interests in the broader region some observers note that washington’s decision to withdraw troops can be regarded as a failure of us policy in afghanistan and could hand moscow the role of main negotiator in the settlement of the interafghan conflict however there is also speculation that the kremlin’s relationship with the taliban is not limited to diplomatic negotiations to reconcile the warring parties but deeper touching on coordination in a joint fight against the islamic state with reference to senior sources in the us military and the afghan government it has been reported that russia is supplying weapons and fuel to the taliban through the countries of central asia get briefed on the story of the week and developing stories to watch across the asiapacific russia does not have sufficient resources to fully implement its ambitious plans to expand its geopolitical influence but at the same time it is trying by all possible means to preserve and strengthen its presence in central asia afghanistan is a clear core factor in that effort such circumstances restrain the countries of the region from building and conducting a more independent foreign policy limiting the interest of western investors and accordingly stalling regional economic development and improvement of the population’s welfare therefore it is extremely important for the united states and the eu to maintain close contact with the countries of the region and provide assistance in their integration into the international community beyond the eurasian space in turn the central asian countries need to continue reforms aimed at increasing the transparency of their economies liberalizing their foreign exchange markets and creating favorable conditions for investors and guarantees to protect their investments enjoying this article click here to subscribe for full access just 5 a month nodirjon kirgizbaev is a former uzbek diplomat and policy analyst    the london conference on afghanistan’s future was wishful thinking for real stability look to china india russia–and iran,3

62,by ezgi yazici november 13 2020 key takeaway russian president vladimir putin’s patient and precise diplomacy outmaneuvered turkish president recep tayyip erdogan in nagornokarabakh the kremlin produced the most significant breakthrough in the disputed zone since 1994 with a russianbrokered agreement on azerbaijani terms putin and azerbaijani president ilham aliyev will likely capitalize upon their respective victories as erdogan fails to gain a greater turkish footprint in the caucasus russia’s upset victory upends turkey’s calculus in nagornokarabakh azerbaijan owes its rapid military success in nagornokarabakh to turkey’s strong backing with arms sales syrian proxy deployments and diplomatic support1 turkey’s patronage likely came with strings attached despite the turks’ friendly relations and historical kinship with azerbaijanis ankara likely saw the conflict as a lowcost opportunity to solidify a turkish foothold in the caucasus while gaining an advantage over moscow and potentially replacing russia as azerbaijan’s key patron azerbaijan’s and turkey’s insistence on armenian withdrawal from nagornokarabakh was likely the key obstacle to the previous ceasefires attempts—leading erdogan to calculate that he was holding the reins of the conflict and could control its end putin seized those reins with the november 9 agreement by forcing armenia to surrender to the azerbaijani demands under exclusive russian control over the implementation process aliyev delivers longawaited victory at a high price the russianbrokered agreement will end armenia’s military presence in nagornokarabakh and its surrounding regions of azerbaijan by december 1—making azerbaijani president ilham aliyev the leader to reclaim azerbaijan’s territories lost during his father’s presidency in 1994 the agreement does not mention baku’s key ally ankara despite earlier discussions of a joint turkishrussian peacekeeping presence in nagornokarabakh2 aliyev will likely enjoy domestic popularity from his kremlindelivered victory but he now faces new challenges with the first russian military presence in azerbaijan in many years and likely damaged relations with turkey putin is the clear winner of the upset victory in nagornokarabakh the kremlin achieved multiple crucial objectives by brokering the november 9 peace agreement between azerbaijan and armenia putin outmaneuvered erdogan as turkey failed to cash in its military success for longterm gains the russianbrokered agreement likely shocked ankara putin compelled yerevan to accept this defeat by taking advantage of armenia’s dependence on russian military power to withstand the turkishbacked azerbaijani push his decision to do so was a clever gambit he sacrificed some goodwill and trust in armenia by failing to come to its aid and then imposing this humiliation on it but yerevan has nowhere to go—no other power or group of states can defend armenia from turkey or azerbaijan had putin instead rallied around his armenian allies he could have stopped or reversed the azerbaijani gains but at the cost of driving azerbaijan much more firmly into the turkish camp erdogan likely miscalculated putin’s willingness to sacrifice an ally temporarily to make a bigger longerterm gain erdogan is unlikely to be able to reverse this setback any time soon he may push for a limited diplomatic role in future resolution processes but the agreement underscores the asymmetrical nature of the russiaturkey relationship russia’s timely diplomatic maneuvering and swift negotiation reversed turkey’s gains in courting azerbaijan and establishing a turkish foothold in the caucasus turkey’s limited gains include a land corridor to connect turkey to baku over the autonomous azerbaijani territory of nakhichevan and a symbolic azeriturkish victory that erdogan will likely benefit from inside turkey6 the success of turkish bayraktar drones will likely increase the demand for turkish military exports as well but those gains are far short of what erdogan was likely expecting in return for the risks he courted in this conflict and they are outweighed by the establishment of a russian military position in nagornokarabakh the war in nagornokarabakh ended on russia’s terms 36 years after another russianbrokered ceasefire putin scored a major longterm gain for russian strategic objectives in the caucasus while showcasing russia’s stronger diplomatic vigor and experience over turkey’s turkey failed to influence the conflict’s end despite its significant military success in backing azerbaijan putin’s upset victory in nagornokarabakh will have profound effects on the future of two former soviet states in the caucasus and turkeyrussia competition across multiple theaters 1  2   dot ru20201110karabakh1583850895html 3  dot runewspagecountrymore dot htmid12323909egnews 4  5  6  dot comarticleturkeytobuildrailwaytolinknakhchivanandazerbaijanafterkarabakhconflict,3
195,elie guckert is a french independent journalist focusing on the syrian civil war disinformation campaigns conspiracy theories and violent extremism  ariane lavrilleux is a french journalist working in the middle east and based in cairo egypt for five years  frank andrews is a british journalist whose reporting mainly focuses on injustice and abuse of power translations français this story was produced with mediapart read their original version of the investigation here in a video posted to youtube in 2019 a group of men and women in matching white tshirts dine alongside two neatlydressed french nationals and a man in military fatigues the frenchmen then hand the man in camouflage a golden award congratulating him on the liberation of the small christian village of maharda in regimecontrolled western syria later in the video another smiling soldier in a different christian village 25km away alsuqaylabiyah receives the same award bashar alassad wearing sunglasses looks down on the ceremony from a large photo on the wall behind  the frenchmen presenting the trophies are benjamin blanchard director general of the french humanitarian ngo sos chrétiens d’orient sosco and alexandre goodarzy its thenhead of mission in syria the syrian combatants receiving the awards are simon alwakil and nabil alabdallah introduced by sosco as men who have “fought since the beginning of the conflict without ever giving up” the ngo has frequently called for donations to support the inhabitants of the villages the men claim to protect  but this investigation has found that alwakil and alabdallah are in fact warlords leading proassad militias accused of war crimes as one researcher for human rights watch believes sosco’s support for them violates the humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality and could make the ngo complicit in war crimes  created in 2013 the french association sos chrétiens d’orient or sos christians of the orient describes itself as “an apolitical ngo” that works to support christians across the middle east as well as in ethiopia pakistan and armenia it has sent hundreds of young french volunteers to the region and facilitated meetings between french politicians and syrian officials the ngo’s mission—one it sees not simply as a humanitarian endeavor but as one of divine and cultural importance—is to renew the links between the christians of the west and those of the “orient” in its own words “the association testifies to the superior vocation of france” the founders french farright activists charles de meyer and benjamin blanchard met in police custody after being arrested at a protest against same sex marriage in paris in 2013  alexandre goodarzy was head of mission in syria until early 2020 when he disappeared for 66 days in iraq with three other sosco workers in undisclosed circumstances the founders say that they created sosco as a reaction to a battle in maaloula a small christian village north of damascus attacked by rebels and jabhat alnusra in 2013 proassad figures frequently use the event to argue that the regime protects minorities against the threat of islamist terrorism sosco now has several permanent offices across regimeheld territories in syria and collects around €7 million in donations every year according to annual financial accounts reviewed by mediapart  sosco presents the town of maharda and the nearby town of alsuqaylabiya as a “symbol of syrian resistance to international terrorism” and a modern incarnation of joan of arc “who followed the lord’s call to fight for her land” the ngo volunteers frequently visit maharda last christmas for example they wrapped presents at the home of militia leader simon alwakil and when alexandre goodarzy married a former sosco volunteer fimy hanna in maaloula in 2018 nabel alabdullah simon alwakil’s son fahed—who also fights in his father’s militia—and salem albarni another soldier of the ndf national defense forces a proregime militia in maharda attended the ceremony as shown in photos posted on instagram by fahed alwakil alexandre goodarzy and benjamin blanchard reviewing ndf artillery positions and ammunition on the maharda frontline in 2016 photo courtesy of mediapart the plight of maharda features heavily on sosco’s website and in fundraising drives in 2019 alone the ngo raised at least €35600 for the village €15600 came via a christian crowdfunding platform while €20000 was raised at an auction organized with marcetienne lansade the farright mayor of the southern french commune cogolin and the farright french columnist eric zemmour in a 2019 interview with prokremlin media outlet sputnik alexandre goodarzy said sosco had “raised 50000 euros for maharda we have spent about 10000 euros for the moment” in answers published online the french association told us  “to this day we have spent around 80000 euros on the towns of maharda and suqaylabiyah” the ngo provided no documents to back up its claim and did not explain how the money was spent sosco gives little information about how it uses the money on the ground in maharda but in goodarzy’s sputnik interview he says they give food “particularly to families whose spouses go to battle”  on the crowdfunding page sosco asks for money for the “deeply grieving families of martyrs” for food clothing medical supplies and materials to help with reconstruction a 2019 article published on sosco’s website reads “we can’t deliver medicine but we bring mr simon alwakil and his men the things they need to get through the day coffee tea matee sic and tobacco”  according to a 2018 story published by the news site almodon about maharda “a delegation from the organisation sos chrétiens d’orient … went to the area and gave the head of the militia varying equipment and assistance” “if it turns out that the money collected is given to the head of the militia and that it is the militia which distributes this money to the families and benefits from it in abuses then sos chrétiens d’orient could be accused of complicity in the crimes committed by these militias” sara kayyali syria researcher at human rights watch hrw told mediapart in one of the numerous youtube videos about maharda posted by sosco in 2016 alexandre goodarzy and benjamin blanchard along with other volunteers can be seen distributing supplies with the help of men in camouflage “we are here with food and covers for the national defense of mhardeh maharda who have been under attack from alnusra for the past couple of weeks” says goodarzy it is unclear which of these supplies were given to local civilians salem albarni who was present at goodarzy’s wedding features in the video he wears civilian clothing but is described as an ndf lieutenant this blurring of lines between humanitarian operations and support to fighters within militias seems to be a pattern of sosco activities in maharda alwakil himself was present for a similar sosco operation in february 2019 sosco appears to breach the eu’s humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality by distributing aid in this way raising money for the families of dead ndf fighters and siding with proassad forces this violates eu stipulations that “humanitarian aid must be provided solely on the basis of need” and “must not favour any side in an armed conflict” this seems of little concern to the association who told us “we never claimed to be neutral against alqaeda” the ndf is “by far the largest militia network in syria” according to analyst aron lund it “was created through the rebranding restructuring and merging of local popular committees and other proassad armed groups starting in 2012” as noted by the syrian opposition ngo projustice loyalist militias are known to have been financed by albustan the socalled charitable organisation of rami makhlouf bashar alassad’s cousin who is currently under european sanctions the guardian revealed in 2016 that unicef had paid albustan more than 260000  in october 2018 the ndf in alsuqaylabiyah thanked a representative of the albustan charity dr yahya youssef for offering medical support to the local militia fighters according to reuters ndf combattants were trained and equipped by iran a longstanding assad ally in 2013 to shore up the government’s depleted armed forces  in his interview with sputnik about maharda sosco’s goodarzy said “the iranians take a few men and train them in iran on weapons handling rocket making etc”  “it is unfortunate to see that it is the shiite islamic republic of iran that defends the christian minorities in the levant” he added “it should be the work of france” the strongly proassad british blogger vanessa beeley—who has also visited and praised maharda and alsuqaylabiya—claimed on twitter in early 2020 that qassem soleimani the formerislamic revolutionary guard corps general helped train the ndf in northern hama posting a picture of alwakil and soleimani it appears the ndf shifted from iranian support to russian patronage after their military intervention in syria on the regime side in 2015 militia leaders often vie for russia’s favour  nabel alabdullah and simon alwakil appear to be close to russian officials  alabdallah went to moscow in 2019 he met with russian special forces and represented alsuqaylabiyah maharda and other villages in the area at the fifth world christian congress in russia  in 2018 the ndf commander received a watch “from the president of russia” engraved with official presidential insignia  and the two ndf commanders have been commended several times by ranking russian officials alwakil and alabdullah have also praised—and appeared in photos with—the notorious brigadier general suheil alhassan commander of the proregime tiger forces who likely oversaw a chemical attack on allataminah in march 2017 as rebel forces tried and failed to push through hama according to a previous bellingcat investigation the tiger forces are also linked to other chlorine attacks carried out by helicopters the ndf took part in the same counteroffensive in hama maharda is just 10km south of allataminah  despite the overwhelming evidence sosco’s goodarzy has dismissed the regime’s responsibility for the chemical attacks—including the one in nearby khan sheikhoun—as “lies” both nabel alabdullah and simon alwakil also coordinate with fighters from the neofascist syrian social nationalist party alexandre goodarzy simon alwakil and benjamin blanchard look out from the mahardah frontline in 2016 photo courtesy of mediapart sosco describes the two militias as selfdefense forces despite both alwakil and alabdallah’s troops appearing to have fought outside of their hometowns “we have had the honour of participating with the syrian army in waging war against terrorism in hama idlib khanaser and aleppo” said alwakil in 2019 following the regime’s scorchedearth policy on rebelheld areas the ndf have stolen goods and furniture from peoples’ homes according to reuters the 2019 offensive in hamaidlib province was no exception loyalist forces that included the ndf reportedly looted houses after seizing villages selling their haul in a market in alsuqaylabiyah according to syrian network for human rights this has become a hallmark of ndf activities ensuring people do not return to their homes the act has become so commonplace that syrians have invented a word ta’afeesh to describe it  simon alwakil and nabel alabdullah have also been personally accused of war crimes according to the blacklist published by opposition ngo projustice simon alwakil was responsible for “the halafiyya halfaya massacre on 16 december 2012 which resulted in the deaths of 25 people when civilian houses were targeted with heavy shelling from artillery” the town of halfaya just 1 km from maharda was then in rebelheld territory and was a target for the syrian air force  projustice has also accused both simon alwakil and nabil alabdullah along with other militia commanders of committing or supporting at least seven war crimes in the hama region including the killing of hundreds of men and women  in only one day in the village of alqubayr they allege that “militia members killed 100 women and children ten of whom were slaughtered with knives and their bodies burned” while in altraymsah tremseh also close to maharda “militia members killed 220 civilians” opposition activists released an audio recording attributed to nabel alabdullah in 2017 in which he calls on what seem to be his foot soldiers to burn down rebel controlledlocal villages after seizing them  he has also been spotted with the infamous irams rockets improvised rocket assisted munitions a signature of iranbacked militias in iraq and syria that are known for their destructive power and inaccuracy—and for causing massive civilian casualties the use of these munitions by the ndf has already been documented by the brown moses blog of bellingcat founder eliot higgins irams were involved in chlorine attacks during the syrian conflict as documented by bellingcat meanwhile sosco sticks doggedly to the regime’s narrative the ngo casts assad as the protector of minorities and militias like those of alwakil and alabdallah as their champions on the ground the ngo’s own videos further contradict its apolitical stance former syria head of mission alexandre goodarzy speaks to camera from an ndf artillery position in a march 2019 video just as alwakil’s militiamen are firing “the terrorists have just bombed” he says “the reply was immediate the national defense with mr simon gave the order to fire and off flew four grad missiles”  based on the description of the location given by goodarzy himself next to shaizar village and the shaizar castle we were able to geolocate the firing position to a spot in the northeast of maharda on top of a hill approximately here rebel and loyalist forces were firing at each other at the time the video was shot according to several reports of strikes hitting maharda and residential areas of allataminah which was then under rebel control  but sosco appears to have picked its side “we deplore… that these journalists devote their energy to harming a charity whose work is recognized and praised in the field” the sosco press officer told us “instead of for example investigating terrorist movements that threaten innocent people” in one eightminute speech goodarzy draws parallels between acts of terrorism in france and the syrian opposition calling on sosco’s donors not merely to make donations but to actively emotionally and spiritually take sides in what his organisation deems a divine battle “at some point you have to be coherent to stop lying to yourself and stop being idiotic” he tells viewers “we really need you we don’t just need your donations… we also need your intelligence you have to open your eyes” after receiving a 41question list from mediapart  sosco sent a long email to their subscribers shared here on facebook on september 7 in which they denied having any knowledge of the war crimes allegations against simon alwakil and nabel alabdullah this despite the fact that the ngo posted an interview with the ndf mahardah leader on their website last february in which he showed them “amused” accusations in the “projihadist media” of “socalled massacres” in its newsletter the french ngo warned its subscribers of the forthcoming investigation and invited them to “stay vigilant and ready even to help sosco if necessary” their campaign was quickly supported by farright french websites breizh info and mediaspresseinfo sosco’s official statement sent the day after september 8 in french can be viewed on the association’s website regarding the specific accusations against him the former head of mission in syria alexandre goodarzy replied on september 8 “i know that you do not respect any ethical rules and that everyone must be available to you but there are still laws in our country i am an employee of sos chrétiens d’orient and i do not understand why you are asking me questions about my employer” the authors would

stated that the air force conducted ‘targeted strikes’  against the militants without specifying the weapons used could emirati drones or other drones have been used in these airstrikes so far there’s no evidence for that particular claim satellite imagery obtained by bellingcat suggests that the united arab emirates air base in assab eritrea is indeed home to drones consistent with china’s wing loong ii model of armed uncrewed aerial vehicles the imagery provided by planet labs shows a drone with a wingspan of just over 20 metres matching the features of the drone model produced by china’s chengdu aircraft industry group the uae acquired wing loong ii drones in 2017 they have also used the drones to conduct operations in yemen in the war against various militant groups including the houthis satellite imagery from planet labs used with permission the drones seen in these images are consistent with those operated by the uae furthermore the recently built drone hangars at the base suggest a larger presence of drones in the area though their active deployment over ethiopia is not yet confirmed however the imagery provides a strong indication of the possibility for their use

unarmed drones moreover the outgoing trump administration has just approved the sales of mq9 reaper drones to the uae provoking protest from human rights groups due to the emirates’ poor human rights record and the relentless airstrikes by a saudi and uae led coalition in yemen which has caused high numbers of civilian casualties there are also media reports that ethiopia has procured chinese ch4 armed drones yet so far no opensource confirmation has been found which might indicate the presence of drones at known bases of the ethiopian airforce however other clues could take the form of information from communications stations or satellite imagery showing the aforementioned shipping containers as explained here by the bard center for the study of the drone in sum the claims made by the tigray forces are not impossible but so far they seem improbable satellite imagery confirms the presence of chineseproduced drones at the uae’s military base in assab but that is all it confirms there is currently no further evidence that these same drones have been involved in operations in support of the ethiopian airforce though there have been confirmed sightings of ethiopian jet fighters

              the stereotype that the state department is overwhelmingly “pale male and yale” has persisted through both democratic and republican administrations even as the united states—and the federal government—has grown more diverse the state department has remained behind the times between 2002 and 2018 the proportion of state department staff identifying as racial or ethnic minorities increased by only 4 percent well below the federal workforce average the proportion of black employees actually fell when presidentelect joe biden and kamala harris take office in january—and when antony blinken is confirmed as secretary of state—they will inherit a state department and a foreign service that has been both demoralized and diminished over the course of the trump administration to rebuild it—and to reassert america’s leadership and values abroad—they must make diversity a priority across the board and especially within the state department and foreign service the lack of diversity at the state department predates the trump administration—although the past four years haven’t helped in late october the department confirmed it had suspended employee training on diversity and inclusion of 189 ambassadors serving overseas today just four are black career foreign service officers and only another four are latino the career pipeline of future ambassadors of color is running low too—in 2008 86 percent of senior foreign service officers were black this march that figure stood at just 28 percent and the trump administration has made a number of highly questionable ambassadorial appointments to important countries—like the white south africanborn handbag designer and maralago member who has been representing the united states in postapartheid south africa for the last year things aren’t any better in the lower ranks either racial and ethnic minority staff are up to 29 percent less likely to be promoted within the state department compared to their white counterparts according to a government accountability office study released earlier this year and stories of hostile work environments abound black foreign service officers posted to consulates in northern mexico have reported being harassed by border patrol officials despite carrying state department credentials others report enduring racist comments from colleagues and if they complain to their supervisors having the onus put on them to educate their colleagues so it’s not surprising that during the trump administration foreign service applications have seen their biggest decline in more than a decade throughout my career in congress i’ve traveled to 30 african nations on those trips my colleagues and i have often been disappointed to find that the foreign service staff of our embassies in africa are overwhelmingly made up of white men and occasionally a smattering of white women this lack of diversity in our diplomatic ranks “not only undermines the power of the united states’ example it also suffocates the potential of the country’s diplomacy” in the words of former deputy secretary of state bill burns and former assistant secretary of state for african affairs linda thomasgreenfield who is now biden’s nominee to serve as us ambassador to the united nations the fact is foreign service personnel are often the first—and sometimes the only—americans whom citizens of other countries meet in person those meetings create openings for education exchange and increased understanding between nations when foreign service officers actually reflect the diversity of the us population—and look more like the locals than like the cast of “leave it to beaver”—they have the opportunity to explain that in the united states no matter your race religion creed or even national origin you too can become the face of america abroad as foreign service veteran uzra zeya wrote “a young syrian’s reaction captured the usual outcome of such exchanges ‘the fact that you’re an american diplomat is what i love about america’” that is why my colleagues in the house of representatives and i introduced the represent america abroad act of 2020 to create midcareer pathways into the state department and the foreign service instead of having to start at the entry level—and stomach huge cuts in pay and responsibility as a result—our idea is to create a program to recruit accomplished professionals from underrepresented groups so they can bring their experience and expertise to bear from their first day on the job building more diversity in the midcareer ranks will also help expand the pool of diverse candidates for posting to us embassies overseas and could even help improve retention of entrylevel staff of color by expanding mentorship and coaching opportunities these midcareer pathways will complement the successes of the rangel and pickering fellowships which have helped increase diversity at the entry level where traditional recruitment measures have fallen short midcareer recruits will of course need to receive training to bring them up to speed in the duties and practical knowledge that are essential for success in the state department and foreign service our bill provides flexibility for the department to design training programs for these recruits so they become familiar with the duties of serving overseas and in washington dc in their first years on the job some state department traditionalists might think this approach is misguided preferring instead to focus on recruiting entrylevel diplomats or retaining existing staff but our bill isn’t an eitheror proposition the decimation of the state department and the foreign service under outgoing president donald trump has been widespread and devastating—especially for employees of color and those from other marginalized groups like lgbtq staff the agency will need to exercise considerable creativity to rebuild the ranks especially at the midcareer and senior levels to meet the diplomatic priorities of the incoming bidenharris administration in a recent article burns and thomasgreenfield—both of whom devoted decades of their lives to the state department—write that the department needs a “toptobottom diplomatic surge” that “will have to incorporate ideas that in the past have seemed heretical … but that today are inescapable” offering midcareer pathways to qualified diverse candidates to enter the state department and foreign service is one piece of the solution—one the agency will need new legal authority to launch that’s what our bill provides but blinken should also retool existing entrylevel programs—not just the rangel and pickering fellowships—to prioritize diversity and to take more innovative approaches to recruiting candidates for career positions existing flexible hiring authorities could provide pathways back into the state department and foreign service for career staff from underrepresented groups who resigned in recent years and the secretary can immediately move to reinstate the diversity equity and inclusion training programs that were scuttled by the trump administration and the new secretary should order an internal review of past promotion decisions to identify systemic barriers to advancement for underrepresented groups and make appropriate reforms including restarting review and promotion processes for qualified staff who were previously passed over taken together our bill and these administrative reforms will increase diversity at all levels of the state department and foreign service within a matter of years rather than decades—to the benefit of the agency its employees and our nation it is our hope that the represent america abroad act will pass the house before the end of the year it won’t solve all of the problems at the state department—not by a long shot but passing this bill is a vital step for building diversity restoring the career ranks and enabling better us diplomacy and the face america presents abroad—including crucially in africa asia and latin america—will at last begin to look more like the country we actually are karen bass serves as the

editor at politico magazine was assistant secretary of state for public affairs during the clinton administration and chief spokesman for secretary madeleine k albright he was also a special negotiator for the demobilization of the kosovo liberation army in 1999 he is now counselor for international affairs at ballard partners where he represents clients in africa europe and the middle east the kosovo government is one of his clients in the case of the globetrotting american diplomat richard holbrooke there is only one degree of separation between him and almost every significant figure in american foreign policy in living memory his surrogate father in high school was dean rusk president john f kennedy’s secretary of state he played tennis with general maxwell taylor jfk’s top military adviser as well with robert kennedy he had lunch with george kennan perhaps the most towering figure of postwar american foreign policy the day his second son was born he wrote one of the pentagon papers—yes those pentagon papers—commissioned by robert mcnamara and years later he ghostwrote the memoirs of clark clifford counselor to presidents from harry truman to lyndon johnson holbrooke was even a member of averell harriman’s vietnam peace delegation in paris as a young foreign service officer that friendship lasted decades and evolved into a special relationship with pamela harriman through whom he socialized with washington’s political and media elite including future presidents jimmy carter and bill clinton later in life he befriended pete peterson a billionaire and commerce secretary for richard nixon who kept him plugged into the new york worlds of finance law and entertainment these were just some of the older men who helped him thrive in international high society’s power elite smoothing his path to high posts in the carter clinton and obama administrations when it came to his peers — men like anthony lake frank wisner strobe talbott and leslie gelb — they were either the closest of friends or in the case of lake best friends and best enemies especially for those of us from a younger generation of american diplomacy george packer’s new biography our man richard holbrooke and the end of the american century is not only a riveting read but also an eyeopening psychodrama revealing the feuds and friendships behind the scenes that often drove and always colored american foreign policy for five decades from vietnam in the 1960s to the balkans in the 1990s to afghanistan today but the book purports to be more than just a biography this tale of holbrooke’s diplomatic ambition and dramatic death is also intended as an authoritative historical statement about the end of an era—and a pessimistic one about the future of american power when it was excerpted in the atlantic for which packer is a staff writer the headline splashed across the cover was elegy for the american century american diplomats we are told will never again be as relevant as holbrooke and his predecessors were because america’s power to influence our world has waned — the american century has come to a close as a consequence of its brilliance as a biography and the seriousness of packers ambitions our man is sure to have an effect on the intensifying debate about the right level of us engagement in today’s world even if a new wave of america first

time and you can contact us here this signup form is protected by recaptcha and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply unfortunately the book draws only part of the lesson it could take from holbrookes career it paints a compelling collective portrait of the vietnam generation’s brutal infighting and especially of its disastrous consequences in iraq—but in focusing on only the negative lessons from that history it risks adding a defense of declinism to the debate over americas role in the world just as an important presidential campaign season is starting up with the iraq fiasco still haunting both parties afghanistan’s conflict approaching the 20year mark and president donald trump destroying what remains of a domestic consensus on american internationalism it is imperative to get the diplomatic history right  the holbrooke story will never be told better than it is in packer’s tale of this oneofakind american diplomat the author is a public intellectual whose evolution from journalist to prominent supporter of president george w bush’s invasion of iraq gives him a particularly profound appreciation of holbrooke’s standing in the foreign policy firmament which may be the reason kati marton holbrooke’s widow allowed him unfettered access to all his diaries and other documents heretofore unavailable this rare access combines with packer’s extensive reporting and gifted writing to bring us as close as we may ever get to the truth about holbrooke’s life and work its high and lows and its rare intersection with many of the finest diplomats and journalists from vietnam bosnia washington and afghanistan the remarkable result reads more like a final draft than a first draft of history too often the picture is not a pretty one holbrooke was already known for his inyourface style—he could be aggressive even bullying in pursuit of us objectives which were often hard to disentangle from holbrookes personal ambitions packer shows us this selfregard playing out in holbrooke’s climb to the top of his profession again and again we see holbrooke crossing lines of propriety like few others revealing how often he leaked to the media and lied to his friends then covered his tracks—sometimes as in the case of frank wisner by fingering a close friend for one of his damaging leaks during the vietnam war although uncomfortable we learn about a critical broken friendship that came back to haunt him his relationship with president bill clintons national security adviser tony lake it was a feud clinton apparently never could understand it was not a matter of war and peace or bureaucratic intrigue that led to lake’s hatred of holbrooke we learn instead it was mostly a consequence of holbrooke telling him that he had fallen in love with lake’s wife so much for policy differences  which makes it even more mindboggling that holbrookes signature achievement was made possible by his friendturnedfoe lake packer portrays lake as having the rare ability to separate his personal feelings from diplomatic business at least during the clinton era indeed it was his cooperation with thenun ambassador madeleine albright in 1995 while holbrooke was on an extended vacation that drove a change in us policy on the catastrophic war in bosnia from passivity and deference to europe’s priorities and the united nation’s studied neutrality to an assertion of american leadership with intensive diplomacy backed by nato’s formidable firepower this policy shift in turn led to the bombardment of the aggressor bosnian serbs and what would be seen as holbrooke’s greatest diplomatic achievement ending the bosnian war   holbrooke left speaks with serbian president slobodan milosevic during a meeting in belgrade in august 1995  ap holbrooke’s role in nato’s 1995 bombardment of bosnian serb forces is often misunderstood as it is by packer it was not until nato finally decided to use air power that the bosnian serb military halted its campaign of ethnic cleansing and mass murder of bosnian muslims despite how it may have seemed to the public the individual most responsible for setting those deadly air strikes in motion was british general rupert smith who used his authority to unleash nato airpower until the bosnian serbs agreed to end their brutal siege of sarajevo and it was lake leading an interagency team on his most important diplomatic mission who presented clinton’s muscular new policy to our european allies in london and paris but when it came time to tell the warring parties of the new strategy the torch was passed with lake’s approval to the man he most despised to finish the job then to give the diplomat his due credit with the power equation finally shifted away from the serb aggressors and in favor of the bosnians holbrooke’s brand of bluster bluff and flattery at the negotiations in dayton ohio proved decisive in bringing peace to that troubled land after three years of war and misery at dayton holbrooke ended a war packer is accurate in saying there will never be another holbrooke for one thing the pool of america’s foreign policy professionals has expanded many times from the relatively small men’s club that dominated the halls of power for so long for another two powerful women albright and hillary clinton soon became the leading players taking the stage as packer’s narrative became a tale of frustrated ambition and sudden death worthy of a greek tragedy in fairness i should say that as a close adviser and spokesman for albright i had a difficult relationship with holbrooke as packer himself reports i wasn’t alone in finding holbrooke exasperating in the extreme in fact i remember once smashing one of those large governmentissued cellphones against the side of the secretary of state’s boeing 707 in frustration after “our man” and i argued over some detail of the kosovo diplomacy in 1999 but i respected his boldness and unequaled knowledge of american diplomacy and in subsequent years our relationship improved to a stage that might be described as a wary professional friendship packers declinism is possible partly because he glides over important achievements he spends many pages bemoaning the fact that the peace in bosnia made at dayton was flawed which has meant little political development and continued ethnic struggles in that once peaceful center of ethnic coexistence all of which is true but it is also the case that most of the balkan countries are democratic independent and allies of the west that came about because in the wake of the years it took to act in bosnia president clinton and secretary albright developed a strategy for the emerging crisis in kosovo that improved on the previous model accelerating decisionmaking and thus managing to head off some of the shortcomings that were codified in dayton  us secretary of state madeleine albright right listens to a comment from holbrooke at a multilateral meeting in october 1998 about the crisis in kosovo  ap holbrooke and albright worked together on kosovo but as that province exploded into violence—when albanians demands for equal rights triggered a violent crackdown by serbian forces controlled by strongman slobodan milosevic—she felt a far greater sense of urgency with respect to the use of force and resisted his continual pressures to make diplomatic engagement with milosevic a higher priority while a peace agreement and diplomatic solution were given every realistic chance milosevic’s clear guilt was not masked in a cloak of constant engagement and theater instead the albright state department moved quickly to establish principles that would synchronize force and diplomacy nato unity and international legitimacy was one principle another was a commitment to a usled peacekeeping force in a postwar environment agreed in advance and american leadership was less bruising than in bosnia as a daily call was established with foreign ministers of the uk france italy and germany to guide the process the partnership with our allies was real in kosovo and not just a fig leaf for washington dictating every outcome the result of this model was an unqualified success kosovo was free and milosevic was overthrown by his own people and sent for trial before the international war crimes tribunal in the hague and the truth is that back then holbrooke was frustrated by his secondtier role and took to secondguessing secretary albright every step of the way  packers excessive focus on the drawbacks of dayton may be part of the reason for his pessimism regarding the power of the united states this dim view of us leadership is then reinforced by the final act of the drama which centers on holbrooke’s inability in 2009 and 2010 to persuade the obama administration to develop the necessary ingredients to negotiate an end to the war in afghanistan  this is the most painful part of the book for admirers of holbrooke having lost again in his never ending quest to be secretary of state—this time to hillary clinton who he regarded as a friend and supporter—he was given a major post as special representative for afghanistan and pakistan by this time the war in afghanistan having been ignored by the bush administration was in its eighth year and provoking comparisons to the vietnam conflict during which holbrooke’s career began this was different than vietnam in an important way afghanistan’s terrorist network had shown on sept 11 2001 what can happen when a faraway conflict comes to america yet for holbrooke and his generation the lessons about getting trapped in a distant and misguided war seemed more and more relevant secretary clinton was hoping that the man who ended a war in bosnia could achieve similar success there but in a meaningful sense holbrooke did not get the mandate he needed if holbrooke were alive today i believe he would be looking over at ambassador zalmay khalilzad trump’s envoy to afghanistan with a certain degree of envy not only has the current administration decided not to expand america’s military deployment—a strategy holbrooke secretly supported in 2009—but khalilzad has also been given space to negotiate with the taliban to end the afghanistan war without a lot of oversight from american officials in washington there is a relevant historical analogy here that holbrooke absorbed from his time with w averell harriman harriman often told holbrooke that when it came to his most successful diplomatic missions—keeping stalin on side for president franklin d roosevelt during world war ii and negotiating a partial nuclear test ban treaty with russia on behalf of jfk—he had a straightforward objective and little or no micromanagement from washington by contrast packer tells us in excruciating detail how holbrooke’s experience as president barack obama’s envoy to afghanistan was the opposite of khalilzad’s today holbrooke said he had the worst office in the state department that the us military was leading around the diplomats rather than having the civilians in control all the while the white house was signaling its contempt for the special representative obama would travel to afghanistan and white house aides would hide the fact of the trip from holbrooke until air force one was landing in kabul and not once would holbrooke—a man who saw himself as the bridge to america’s titanic inside players of diplomacy—ever meet the president alone  this was holbrooke’s world in 2009 and 2010 the last years of his life and in his final months of his life several generals worked together to build a case for his dismissal we learn we watch how this formerly formidable bureaucratic infighter is reduced to begging colleagues for support and praise with only secretary clinton still in his corner and little to show for all the effort expended holbrooke literally bursts his biggest blood vessel in the secretary of state’s office—the office to which he had aspired for so many decades—and dies in the operating room later that night  as a biographer packer has proved beyond doubt that holbrooke was an almostgreat man he is right to demonstrate how rare it is for someone who is not secretary of state to be so dominant and prominent in american foreign policy  is american international leadership really at end is it really true that american diplomacy is no longer capable of greatness but the second part of his thesis is more assertion than analysis is american international leadership really at end is it really true that american diplomacy is no longer capable of greatness “the american century he writes ended in baghdad and helmand in aleppo and odessa and in beijing … another place the american century ended was bosnia”  the shortcomings of the dayton plan for bosnia’s future prospects and the length and seeming futility of the war in afghanistan are reasons for frustration but do they justify packer’s grandiose assertions about the end of american leadership no doubt americas costly and illconsidered occupation in iraq has also damaged perceptions of us leadership confidence in international action has been shattered in many western countries too packer himself went through his own wringer on the question of us intervention he was one of many prominent liberals who supported the iraq war and then was understandably demoralized by the failures to stabilize iraq after the fall of saddam his compelling account the assassins gate documents his disillusionment packer wasn’t the only liberal hawk mugged by the bush administration’s multiple failures before during and after the iraq invasion but just as lessons from history must be learned they should not be overlearned in my view the model of american leadership using diplomacy backed by force that president clinton and secretary albright enunciated and implemented in kosovo—us leadership international support a postwar plan and international peacekeeping—has never really been applied since indeed secretary of defense donald rumsfeld famously told the pentagon that nothing about the balkan wars should be seen as a guide for the future sure enough in afghanistan the bush administration refused allied support and rejected nato’s historic offer of help before the war and it refused to send a peacekeeping force to key areas when the taliban fell instead key resources and energy were diverted from afghanistan back in 2002 when they could have been decisive and attention turned to the illfated invasion in iraq just as dangerous was the overreaction to the iraq fiasco that led to international abdication in syria failure to act in syria has devastated the international order with hundreds of thousands dead millions of refugees destabilizing syria’s neighbors and europe and a previously unthinkable vacuum that the kremlin has filled with its massive military campaign to save bashar assad and return russia to the region to the detriment of us all  the united states will never again have the near total monopoly on military power and economic production we had at the end of world war ii too often that moment is set as some kind of baseline when in fact it was an aberration the growth of other global economies such as germanys and japans is more a sign of a successful us policy than a diminution of us economic power it was our policy to promote american growth by building large trading partners in europe asia and around the world that policy has worked as billions of people’s standard of living has risen nor will there be another unipolar moment like the 1990s when soviet communism’s collapse left the united states without rivals russia has rebuilt its military and the chinese are doing the same china and russia are genuine adversaries seeking to undermine american power and potential and many of our successful friends around the world have grown weary of a sometimesaggressive leadership style but most of the ingredients of america’s leadership position remain it will require a new resolve to lead internationally new approaches to tap the potential of our partners and friends and restored confidence in american leadership in truth it is more a matter of will than wallet books that suggest american greatness is behind us can serve to sap that will without justification we are still the indispensable nation for instance when it comes to leading our hemisphere against a regime in venezuela that has impoverished its people and caused chaos and instability across the region and leading our european allies to contain russia’s international aggression and contempt for the western institutions many thought it wished to join and in asia where china’s new more aggressive leadership presents clearer dangers to the region the openness to american leadership shows what distinguishes us from global powers of the past we have voluntary military relationships with dozens of countries in east asia and the greater middle east—the kinds of alliances china will never have countries like vietnam want american ships visiting their ports japan thailand and others may have specific problems with the current administration but they do not want to be dominated by china they still look to america to balance chinese power keep the sea lanes open and allow their economic growth to continue none of them not even north korea wants an alliance with communist chinathe secret to wielding american power on behalf of enlightened international leadership is much the same today as it has been since the days after world war ii when american diplomacy was harnessed to create decades of international peace and growing prosperity just as those diplomats created alliances and a structure of partnerships to support american leadership it is the way we manage our allies and partners that will be the key determinant of what is possible and what is not maintaining and expanding alliances has not been a high priority for the trump administration and the president’s statements and actions too often weaken our key asset but when trump is gone those alliances can be rebuilt and strengthened perhaps they wont be quite as strong as they were in the 1990s but the world has changed since then certainly they can be strong enough for american diplomacy to matter again and for american diplomats to do great things   at a refugee camp in northwest pakistan in 2009 holbrooke then the top us envoy to pakistan and afghanistan talks with a displaced man inside his tent  ap they may do these great things without the kind of personal references to the wise men of the postwar era that holbrooke was famous for but there is still a lot of work to do and for as far as we can see america will still be the strongest military power—with alliances that multiply that power exponentially—and have an economic strength second to none and a political system that painful as it to watch sometimes is far more admired and emulated around the world than the alternatives  ironically packer deploys some of the hubris and hyperbole he correctly attributes to holbrooke by making a subtheme of his biography the idea of the end of an era of american leadership and unfortunately it seems that packer the biographer has adopted some of the myths of american decline that have been popular in recent years certainly we have had successes and failures but it is far from clear from this account that american leadership has reached a point of no return in the end if we marshal our substantial power and the energy of our allies there is every possibility that the united states will play an equally important role in the next century as we did in the last one yes we need to regain the will we have lost since the iraq fiasco and the 2008 financial crisis but the possibilities are still there whether or not our brilliant biographer can see them  california   by jeremy b white

50,regiondetailtext persondetailtext organizationdetailtext seriesdescription  limitto140 notice the critical threats project frequently cites sources from foreign domains all such links are identified with an asterisk  for the readers awareness the us withdrawal from syria will likely do catastrophic damage to america’s global leadership and value as an ally it will also likely fasttrack the islamic state’s return in syria and signal weakness that will embolden salafijihadi militants globally it has already energized us adversaries russian forces are currently backfilling american positions in northeastern syria the american retreat from syria has parallels in africa in libya the us has failed to support the internationally recognized government and us counterterrorism partner the government of national accord gna forces led by wouldbe strongman khalifa haftar attacked the gna in tripoli in april 2019 torpedoing the unled peace process haftar’s forces which have significant backing from regional states and russia are besieging many of the same militiamen who fought with us support against the islamic state in libya in 2016 the gna has few options but to seek turkish military support and russian mediation meanwhile salafijihadi militants are recruiting as the war drags on russia’s potential kingmaking in libya reflects greater ambitions the kremlin is expanding its influence in africa to advance a number of strategic and grand strategic objectives as nataliya bugayova and darina regio from the institute for the study of war argue these objectives include expanding russia’s military footprint mitigating sanctions’ effects and establishing a “network of geopolitical alliances and shared global information space” that positions russia as a “revitalized great power” and challenger to the usled world order vladimir putin will host the first landmark russiaafrica summit in sochi on october 23–24 russia’s campaign in africa endangers us security interests on the continent among them counterterrorism objectives any kremlin effort dubbed counterterrorism should give us pause for two reasons first the kremlin frequently uses counterterrorism as justification for establishing a military footprint that primarily serves other objectives and is not sufficient to conduct a counterterrorism mission see syria second the kremlin actually undermines counterterrorism objectives by enabling harsh crackdowns on vulnerable populations and strengthening repressive regimes therefore worsening conditions that drive salafijihadi insurgencies in the long term  russian engagement is increasing in three hubs of salafijihadi activity in africa libya the western sahel and nigeria and mozambique where a salafijihadi threat is emerging this engagement is likely intended to develop demand in these countries for russia’s military services and undermine a perception of the west as a reliable partner the kremlin will continue to deliver more security help such as limited deployments of pmcs and military advisers to more african countries it will amplify these limited investments with information campaigns while russia cannot deliver military or other aid on the scale of the west it will leverage limited investments to gain influence over african countries’ decisionmaking to influence areas of core russian interest including military sales and security reach nataliya bugayova from the institute for the study of war contributed insight to this brief figure 1 overlapping threats russian security cooperation and the salafijihadi threat in africa              west africa north africa east africa updated october 16 2019 global counterterrorism efforts are rapidly receding with the end of counter–islamic state operations in syria and the withdrawal of us troops in october 2019 this withdrawal sets conditions for the rapid return of the islamic state it also damaged america’s reputation with current and potential counterterrorism partners wary of suffering the same fate as the abandoned syrian kurdish forces the us administration also seeks to withdraw american troops from afghanistan a course that will likely be delayed rather than altered by the breakdown of talks with the taliban however the salafijihadi movement continues to make gains in africa including in areas in which previous counterterrorism efforts had significantly reduced salafijihadi groups’ capabilities the movement is positioned to take advantage of the expected general reduction in counterterrorism pressure to establish new support zones consolidate old ones increase attack capabilities and expand to new areas of operations the return of african salafijihadists from prisons in syria will likely accelerate these trends the salafijihadi movement including al qaeda and islamic state affiliates and allies is on the offensive in burkina faso on the counteroffensive in libya and stalemated in mali somalia and nigeria however conditions in the last three countries favor the salafijihadi movement rather than its opponents over the next 12–18 months libya’s civil war reignited on a large scale in april will continue to fuel the salafijihadi comeback for at least the next several months possibly allowing the islamic state or al qaeda to regain some of the territory they controlled before major operations against them from 2016 to 2019 the islamic state’s comeback in libya is part of its global effort to reconstitute capabilities after military defeats an effort that the group’s leader abubakr al baghdadi sought to galvanize in a september audio message stalemates in somalia and mali rest on the continued efforts of international coalitions support for which is rapidly eroding and on local partners that have demonstrated their inability to govern effectively or establish legitimacy in the eyes of their people amid these conditions us africa command is shifting its prioritization from the counterterrorism mission to great power competition a move also intended to reduce risk after a 2017 attack killed four servicemen in niger us and european powers aim to turn over counterterrorism responsibilities to regional forces of limited effectiveness — such as the g5 sahel which is plagued by funding issues and the african union mission in somalia which is beginning a scheduled drawdown the salafijihadi movement currently has four main centers of activity in africa libya mali and its environs the horn of africa and the lake chad basin these epicenters are networked allowing recruits funding and expertise to flow among them the rise of the salafijihadi movement in these and any other place is tied to the circumstances of sunni muslim populations the movement takes root when salafijihadi groups can forge ties to vulnerable populations facing existential crises such as civil war communal violence or state neglect or abuse local crises are the incubators for the salafijihadi movement and can become the bases for future attacks against the us and its allies     mali and burkina faso the salafijihadi movement is expanding more rapidly in the western sahel than in any other african region as communal violence and state fragility spread the movement’s epicenter in this region is mali salafijihadi groups are active in the country’s north and have spread into the country’s center where ethnicbased violence has increased in the past two years neighboring burkina faso is destabilizing rapidly as salafijihadi groups take root in its north and east several salafijihadi factions are cooperating particularly in the mali–burkina faso border area to drive out security forces and establish themselves as the de facto governing power the violence is causing a humanitarian crisis that includes retaliatory massacres of civilians in central mali and mass displacement in burkina faso  largescale salafijihadi attacks are causing popular backlash against sahel governments hundreds of malians protested in the aftermath of nearsimultaneous attacks on malian army and g5 sahel joint force bases near the burkinabe border on september 30 citing the government’s failure to deliver security and transparency attacks in burkina faso have also generated antigovernment backlash an august 29 attack on a burkinabe army base harmed morale and stoked political jockeying see prior africa files for more on the september 30 attacks in boulikessi and mondoro mali and the august 29 attack in koutougou burkina faso popular dissatisfaction with the malian security response and the french intervention in mali the subject of recent protests is creating an opportunity for greater russian military involvement in mali a civil society organization called the “malian patriots group” has made several petitions calling for russian military support to resolve the deteriorating security situation in mali this latest petition follows the signing of a russiamali security cooperation agreement in late june 2019 forecast russia will likely deliver security assistance to mali in the coming year by either deploying pmcs or providing counterterrorism training as of october 16 2019 a salafijihadi leader in central mali announced a ceasefire with a rival militia that will bolster salafijihadi governance credentials amadou koufa the leader of an al qaeda in the islamic maghreb aqim–aligned faction from the fulani ethnic group announced a ceasefire with the dogon ethnic militia dan na ambassagou though its implementation is unclear koufa’s group has stoked ethnic violence in central mali’s mopti region in recent years to delegitimize the state and present itself as the fulani community’s defender salafijihadi militants in burkina faso are pursuing two major lines of effort to increase their freedom of movement and control over northern burkinabe populations see figure 2 a cluster of salafijihadi activity around djibo the capital of soum province indicates that militants will likely mount an attack to drive out the remaining burkinabe military presence in that region further south in bam province salafijihadi groups have nearly completely degraded the government’s authority and are now targeting local leadership and selfdefense groups   figure 2 salafijihadi militants degrade security and consolidate control in northern burkina faso  source american enterprise institute an unprecedented attack on a mosque in northern burkina faso may be intended to trigger retaliatory attacks unidentified attackers killed 15 worshippers in salmossi in oudalan province in northern burkina faso on october 11 the islamic state in the greater sahara isgs may be responsible as groups affiliated with al qaeda generally eschew attacks on places of worship however this kind of attack would be unusual for isgs militants began a campaign of attacks targeting christians in burkina faso in 2019 and may be attempting to stoke confessional violence the death of senior burkinabe salafijihadi leaders may temporarily disrupt attacks in central mali and northern burkina faso a reported raid may have killed the leader of ansar al islam jafar dicko and the group’s deputy leader oumarou bolly on october 1 ansar al islam may have participated in the september 30 attacks in mali and has played a key role in the spread of the salafijihadi insurgency in burkina faso since 2016 forecast salafijihadi militants will continue to take control of populations in northern burkina faso and may ultimately establish de facto governance in the area they will likely mount a large assault on djibo the remaining burkinabe military position in soum province in the coming months to consolidate control militants based in mali or burkina faso will attack tourist or christian targets in gulf of guinea countries in the next 6–12 months updated october 16 2019   nigeria a salafijihadi insurgency is strengthening in the northeast of nigeria africa’s most populous country the nigerian government despite repeated claims of victory has ceded much of the remote northeast to militants currently split into two main factions — the islamic state west africa province iswa and boko haram — which also operate across nigeria’s border in niger chad and cameroon the nigerian state is preoccupied with other domestic security and political challenges and is unlikely to rectify the conditions that led to boko haram’s formation and iswa’s growth the nigerian army has adopted a new strategy of retreating to “super camps” and leaving militants unchallenged in the countryside the official strategy is intended to concentrate wellarmed and mobile fighting forces in fortified positions from which they can rapidly respond to militant activity in effect soldiers are withdrawing to fortresslike positions and allowing militants—who are often better armed than the army—to conduct unchallenged attacks on towns in borno state in northeastern nigeria iswa has temporarily seized several towns in borno and yobe states since the super camp strategy began and has featured these raids in its propaganda the new governor of borno state approved mobilizing thousands of nigerian hunters to fight boko haram and iswa nigerian authorities prevented a similar operation five years ago the hunters are intended to be more effective than the nigerian military because of their knowledge of the local terrain however they may lack sufficient supply and armaments for the mission the nigerian army has cracked down on international nongovernmental organizations ngos after accusing them of aiding boko haram and iswa the army closed the offices of action against hunger and mercy corps in late september iswa kidnapped and executed an action against hunger employee in the same period the closure of ngos will harm local populations the army’s role in these closures may cause further grievances against the state and encourage more communities to tolerate iswa as an alternative source of governance the nigerian government is seeking a military cooperation agreement with russia that would allow it to intensify a counterproductive strategy against iswa and boko haram nigerian president muhammadu buhari will attend the russiaafrica summit in sochi on october 23–24 he is seeking a technical cooperation agreement to acquire helicopters tanks and other materiel russia is an attractive partner for the nigerian government because it does not attach human rights conditions to its arms sales the obama administration blocked the sale of lightattack aircraft to nigeria following a 2017 strike on a displaced persons’ camp attacks on civilian populations undermine counterterrorism efforts by delegitimizing the nigerian government and allowing salafijihadi groups to present themselves as defenders of vulnerable communities forecast the withdrawal of nigerian forces to super camps will allow iswa to expand its governance in borno state iswa’s focus on delivering governance in its areas of control has already convinced some civilians that iswa provides a viable alternative to the largely absent nigerian state the islamic state will use iswa’s protostate as evidence of success as it seeks to recover from military losses in iraq and syria updated september 17 2019     libya russia increased military support for its preferred libyan partner khalifa haftar’s libyan national army lna in an attempt to break the stalemate around tripoli and resolve the libya conflict in a way that favors russian interests russian pmcs from the wagner group joined lna forces on the tripoli frontline and have since suffered casualties the reported presence of russian aircraft at a libyan airbase may indicate that official russian military personnel are also present the kremlin seeks to position itself as a broker even while increasing support for the lna russia’s deputy foreign minister and libya’s foreign minister discussed the countries’ bilateral relationship and the upcoming russiaafrica summit on october 10 russia’s interests in libya include acquiring military basing or expanding access to mediterranean naval facilities casting itself as a peacemaker and alternative to the west drawing neighboring egypt away from the us reactivating qaddafiera economic deals and securing new ones and securing influence over hydrocarbon resources that in turn increase its leverage over europe haftar’s campaign whether it succeeds or fails will benefit the salafijihadi movement in libya the lna launched its offensive on tripoli in april and has yet to breach the city’s defenses even with significant support from russia the uae egypt and saudi arabia meanwhile the civil war has destabilized parts of libya where salafijihadi militants are active notably the far southwest the islamic state and aqim have havens and access to smuggling and trafficking routes in this region and have attempted to recruit from local populations the islamic state’s increased recruitment in recent months necessitated a series of us airstrikes to curtail the threat in the past month even if haftar succeeds his methods—including an overly broad definition of who is a terrorist—will fuel a longterm salafijihadi insurgency the unbacked peace process in libya remains stalled plans for a conference in germany to resume this process have been delayed the us is actively sustaining its partnerships with the gna on the economy development and counterterrorism but these are stopgap measures without a credible effort to end the civil war forecast the unled peace process in libya is unlikely to succeed as libyan factions and their foreign backers remain committed to military campaigns to secure their objectives russia will raise its profile as a potential broker and may attempt to facilitate a negotiated end to the conflict that secures its interests particularly if haftar’s offensive remains stalled separately the islamic state may attempt an attack in the coming weeks to prove its continued strength but will otherwise reduce its activity for several months while recovering from us strikes’ effects the islamic state will continue its recruitment efforts in southwestern libya updated october 16 2019   tunisia counterterrorism operations have limited the ability of salafijihadi groups to conduct attacks in tunisia in the past several years for example militants failed to conduct attacks during two rounds of voting in tunisia’s president elections in september and october despite threats grievances that feed salafijihadi recruitment persist however and the potential for instability that could galvanize the salafijihadi movement remains tunisia faces serious economic problems that its nascent democratic government has struggled to address salafijihadi militants in tunisia may be shifting to lowlevel individual attacks that require less coordination than past highprofile operations and bombings a suspected salafijihadi sympathizer killed a french national and injured a tunisian soldier in a stabbing attack in bizerte in northern tunisia on october 14 this follows a similar “extremist” stabbing that killed a policeman and injured a soldier in bizerte on september 23 a similar attack occurred in tozeur in southwestern tunisia earlier in september tunisians selected their next president law professor kais saied will become the president of tunisia following a decisive victory over media mogul nabil karoui in a runoff election saied is a political novice who has promised to improve tunisia’s ailing economy and fight corruption forecast leadership losses will prevent aqim’s tunisian affiliate from conducting an offensive attack during the tunisian election season islamic state cells in tunisia will attempt attacks in this same period and are more likely to succeed but any attack will likely be unsophisticated updated on september 17 2019     al qaeda’s affiliate in east africa al shabaab is waging an insurgency in somalia that threatens neighboring kenya and ethiopia a stalemate is eroding in al shabaab’s favor as african union peacekeeping forces draw down ahead of their scheduled withdrawal in 2021 al shabaab seeks to expand its insurgency into kenya and ethiopia in part as punishment for their participation in the peacekeeping mission the group also seeks to radicalize muslim communities in kenya and ethiopia al shabaab frequently attacks security forces in eastern kenya and has conducted multiple highprofile attacks on soft targets in the country since 2013 al shabaab also recently plotted attacks in ethiopia and may be seeking to increase its operations there for more on the salafijihadi threat to ethiopia read the october 1 africa file al shabaab attempted one of its most ambitious attacks ever along kenya’s southern coast in october kenyan police foiled an al shabaab plot in the port city of mombasa on october 1 police killed multiple al shabaab suspects and arrested others days after police warned of an al shabaab cell traveling from somalia the cell’s planned targets included mombasa’s international airport the kenya ports authority headquarters and a railway station al shabaab recruits from mombasa but has not conducted many attacks there since 2014 multiple al shabaab cells in kenya may have facilitated the plot the suspects may have planned to use un or police vehicles that al shabaab militants had seized hundreds of miles away in northern kenya see figure 3 the attackers had support from al shabaab members in mombasa who likely belong to multiple ethnic groups underscoring al shabaab’s ability to recruit across a wide spectrum of kenyan society al shabaab likely intended the attack to galvanize somalis and coastal kenyan muslims antikenyan sentiment is currently high in somalia in part due to a kenyansomali maritime dispute al shabaab’s emir released a rare speech in september accusing kenya of stealing somali territory and exploiting its natural resources the planned attack in mombasa would have struck a symbolic blow against east africa’s largest port al shabaab may have also sought to incite a harsh kenyan crackdown on coastal muslims kenya’s heavyhanded efforts to suppress al shabaab along the coast between 2012 and 2014 alienated many coastal muslims and helped al shabaab recruit from those communities forecast al shabaab will attempt another highprofile attack along the kenyan coast within the next 12 months and will activate cells for smaller more frequent attacks in the area al shabaab will continue recruiting from the coast while simultaneously expanding its recruitment among muslimminority communities in kenya’s interior updated

359,research questions what does teaching and learning look like as schools are reopening this fall in the face of the pandemic how are teachers coping with the rapidly changing educational environment what are some of the main challenges that principals and teachers are facing this school year what are the supports that they need to address these challenges school districts across the united states have had to make many difficult decisions to prepare for the 2020–2021 school year amid the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic however until now little information has been gathered directly from teachers and principals about what is happening on the ground their perceptions of how students are faring and which students they feel are most at risk of falling behind in this data note researchers summarize selected findings on teaching and learning in the face of a pandemic by drawing on surveys administered via the rand american educator panels aep to nationally representative samples of teachers and principals in early october 2020 the findings paint an alarming picture of how the 2020–2021 school year is unfolding even though teachers are working more hours than they were before the pandemic students are likely not getting all the curriculum content and instruction that they would have received during a normal school year students from vulnerable populations might be particularly likely to slip through the cracks high proportions of teachers report that they are not receiving adequate guidance to serve many of these populations — especially if they are teaching them remotely — and low percentages of principals indicate that their schools are offering the tutoring needed to help students catch up there are no signs that the pandemic is slowing and policymakers must act fast to ensure that the entire school year is not another one of its casualties key findings most schools are still providing either wholly or partially remote instruction twenty percent of principals reported that most students were receiving fully inperson instruction 33 percent reported fully remote instruction and 47 percent reported using a hybrid model the highestpoverty schools and schools serving high percentages of minority students were less likely to offer inperson instruction according to teachers students are less prepared to participate in gradelevel work however only 10 percent of principals indicated that their school was providing more students with tutoring or supplemental courses teachers are having difficulties contacting all students and holding them accountable on average teachers reported being able to contact only four out of every five students only 59 percent of teachers reported assigning letter grades during fall 2020 the pandemic has lowered teacher morale and contributed to increased burnout only a third of teachers reported being satisfied with the decisions that their schools or districts had made regarding instruction some 80 percent reported feelings of burnout access to digital devices and the internet continues to be a problem principals in the highestpoverty schools reported that on average only 80 percent of their students had adequate internet access at home teachers providing remote instruction have particular need for more supports most teachers providing remote instruction reported that they had not received adequate guidance to support students from vulnerable populations four in ten remote teachers say that they have a major or very major need for strategies to help students catch up to grade level recommendations states and the federal government should be directing much more funding and resources to support schools delivering remote instruction — particularly if those schools are serving highpoverty and highminority populations making schools safer to attend in person should be a major priority for state and federal governments as well as for school districts related products,3
110,key points background the loyal white knights lwk are one of the 35 to 40 groups that make up the organized klan movement in the united states like the rest of the stagnant klan movement the lwk are currently operating in the shadows of segments of the white supremacist movement that have moved on from the outdated stigmatized klan robes and burning crosses the lwk based in pelham north carolina is the largest and the most active klan group in the country with approximately 100 members approximately 40 percent of the active klans in the united states – including the lwk  promote an ideology infused with neonazi beliefs  in addition to being antiblack antiimmigration antimuslim and homophobic they are also virulently antisemitic over the years the lwk’s willingness to embrace neonazi tenets has allowed them to form symbiotic relationships with neonazi groups from 2012 through early 2016 the lwk participated in a number of public rallies alongside members and associates of the neonazi national socialist movement nsm   adl lwk attending rally with nsm in november 2012 in charlotte north carolina   in april 2016 approximately 40 members of the lwk participated the nsm’s national rally in rome georgia following the rally the lwk played a role in the formation of the aryan nationalist alliance since renamed nationalist front a coalition of several other nazified klan groups racist skinhead crews and neonazis the lwk’s participation in this formal alliance was shortlived after a few months the lwk was no longer listed on the nsm website as part of the alliance and the groups’ joint rallies ended abruptly     adl lwk attending the nsms april 2016 rally in rome georgia   origin and leadership   christopher eugene barker and his wife amanda barker formed the lwk in 2011 and have led the group ever since at the lwk’s height they had 200 or more members but those numbers have decreased by at least half thanks in large part to christopher’s many arrests for a range of crimes including alcohol related offenses assault domestic battery threats and weapons violations for extended periods of time amanda has served as the lwk’s de facto leader while christopher was limited by a courtordered probationary agreement that he could not be “in the company of any gang memberssecurity threat group members including but not limited to the ku klux klan” despite the nonassociation clause barker and california grand dragon william ernest hagen were arrested in december 2016 on charges related to the alleged felony assault of another klansman during a klan gathering at barker’s home in yanceyville north carolina the charges were later dropped after the victim refused to testify but news of the brawl further damaged barker’s reputation as a klan leader which was already tarnished by rumors that he acted as an fbi informant against another klansman glendon scott crawford in december 2016 crawford was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison for planning to use a radiation dispersal device to kill muslims and barack obama activity the most consistent klan activity involves the distribution of racist antisemitic homophobic and islamophobic fliers on doorsteps and driveways around the country from 2014 through 2018 the antidefamation league tracked an average of 79 klan fliering incidents per year the loyal white knights are by far the most active fliering group  over the past five years they have been responsible for more than half 217 of 394 incidents or 55 of all klan propaganda distributions more than three quarters 67 of 85 incidents or 79 of 2018 klan propaganda incidents are attributed to the lwk     throughout 2018 the lwk’s propaganda has reached communities in 15 states including california florida georgia illinois indiana maryland minnesota new jersey new york north carolina ohio pennsylvania south dakota virginia and west virginia though the group’s fliers do occasionally appear in more farflung states the lwk

341,the north sea between the uk and northwestern europe was the birthplace of the offshore wind industry and nations around the coast of the sea such as the uk denmark germany and the netherlands are the leading markets for the technology offshore wind has a number of advantages over onshore projects – the wind out at sea is stronger and more reliable and there is less visual intrusion so turbines can be bigger enabling them to generate more power the 13mw haliadex turbine made by ge currently the world’s largest wind turbine can generate enough electricity to power the average uk household for two days with each spin of its 220metre rotor for example and turbines are continuing to grow with siemens gamesa working on a 15mw device the north sea is the epicentre of the sector for good reason – it is not just perennially windy but shallow enough to enable turbine foundations to be fixed to the sea floor there are many parts of the world that have wind resources as good as if not better than the north sea and large cities to provide a market for their power but that currently cannot take advantage of this because the sea floor is too deep the industry has been working to overcome this by creating floating wind turbines but until recently the platforms could only support much smaller turbines than current projects industry sources say that floating wind is where bottomfixed turbines were a decade ago – that is at the very earliest stages of development but now floating wind has taken a giant step forward and looks set to see similar growth rates to fixed turbines after mhi vestas installed the largest and most powerful floating turbine at a project off the coast of scotland vestas is the world’s biggest turbine manufacturer and through its joint venture with mitsubishi heavy industries it has now installed the most powerful turbine at a floating wind project a 95mw device that is now in place at the kincardine wind farm off the coast of scotland – the first of five to be sited at the project that will have a blade tip height of 190 meters and provide enough power for around 35000 homes more for you fauci says new stayathome orders likely as biden advisor warns of looming disaster for us hospitals sec chair jay clayton will step down by the end of 2020 promising vaccine news makes case for more stimulus ‘even more compelling’ former fed official says it follows the commissioning in the summer of the 25mw windfloat atlantic floating offshore wind farm off the coast of portugal which features three mhi vestas 84mw devices that were the previous largest floating turbines while fixed turbines sit on foundations around 1530 meters deep the water at the kincardine array is 6080m deep because they can be deployed in deeper water the semisubmersible floating turbines can be used off coasts where there is no shallow seabed or further out at sea to take advantage of stronger and more consistent winds they are also easier to build install and maintain fixed turbines have to be installed in place requiring huge lift vessels to install the foundations and to transport and assemble parts onsite as well as erecting the turbine floating turbines by contrast can be built on land assembled in port and towed to their site using standard tugs leading to significant cost savings and when the devices need maintenance they can simply be towed back to port where engineers can work on them in safe and hospitable conditions rather than having to carry out work hundreds of feet above the ocean possibly in stormy weather now that the industry is proving that it can build platforms to take larger turbines floating wind is all set to become a key energy source for coastal cities around the world in the next decade mike scott i write about the intersection of business and the environment and the vital importance of environmental social and governance esg issues to businesses and the … read more i write about the intersection of business and the environment and the vital importance of environmental social and governance esg issues to businesses and the investors that help to fund them that means anything from climate change to executive pay as well as disruptive technologies from renewable energy and energy storage to nanotechnology these issues can have a profound impact on company performance but are still largely ignored by many investors i have been a journalist for more than 20 years including 9 years at the financial times since 2006 as a freelance journalist i have written for a range of titles including the ft bloomberg new energy finance the guardian the daily telegraph as well as for think tanks such as friends of europe and corporate clients including siemens rabobank pwc deloitte and akzonobel,3

101,the anonghost team is a fluid international network of hackers that targets government corporate and private websites around the world to bring attention to its extremistinspired agenda the network’s ability to consistently attack its targets with proterror and antisemitic messages places them at the forefront of ideologically motivated cyberthreats  for several years the anonghost team’s activity has primarily involved defacing websites with antiwestern antiisrael and antisemitic messages in recent months the network has been particularly unam­bigu­ous about its support for the islamic state in iraq and syria isis declaring on its facebook profile “long live isis… we support all mujahideens who defend islam… we support isis 100” the network’s cyberattacks on behalf of isis augment the terrorist organization’s broader online propaganda efforts by helping bring its message directly to targets in the us in addition to cyberattacks the network has launched a number of software tools designed to enable users to conduct their own cyberattacks against their targets of choice for example in march 2015 anonghost alerted its supporters through its social media profiles about software it created enabling users to initiate denial of service dos attacks while the actual number of hackers affiliated with the anonghost team is unclear the nature of the group’s ongoing attacks in the us and elsewhere highlights its own development and underscores broader emerging cyberthreats  the anonghost team has launched several cyberattacks against various government targets in the us often explaining its actions as acts of resistance against a long list of alleged violations committed by the us government in june 2015 anonghost claimed to have defaced a white house website with a statement that read we have witnessed your unjust laws you have abused human rights creating wars financial crisis bombings arresting innocent people assassinating using media propaganda to spread your lies to justify your corrupt act after allwere aware  you are the real terrorists  sic it released a similar message in april 2015 when it announced on youtube opusa one of several campaigns it has launched to target the us the group first used the opusa moniker in 2013 when it published a list of more than 700 websites it claimed to have defaced in the past year anonghost has claimed responsibility for at least four cyberattacks on us law enforcement affiliated websites including the wayne county indiana sheriff’s department the rapides parish louisiana police jury the larimer colorado sheriff’s office and the sheriff’s office in piatt county illinois the rapides parish police jury site was defaced with the seal of anonghost and the slogan “death to israel… viva hamas qassam”  the wayne county sheriff’s office was also defaced with the seal of anonghost and a message that read “stop killing muslims” along with a list of several countries worldwide the vandalized website also included images of civilian casualties in gaza and images of american soldiers abusing iraqi civilians the network has also carried out several cyberattacks in the us on behalf of isis in a march 27 2015 statement posted to the file sharing website pastebin a prominent anonghost hacker claimed to have hacked into the pentagon federal credit union and leaked personal data this claim has not been confirmed the statement written in english and arabic read in part “long live isis and death to usa” “the islamic state will remain in spite of america” and “death to america” university websites around the country have also been attacked on multiple occasions by anonghost the attacks have often targeted subdomains of university sites which tend to have vulnerabilities that enable hacks to occur more easily while these sites may be targets of opportunity the messages left are similar to the ones anonghost leaves on government sites and are part of the network’s effort to spread its messages broadly in june 2015 the group claimed on its official facebook page that it hacked the website of the university of arizona and shared recordings of what appears to be a defacement of a number of university’s website subdomains the group posted messages on the defaced websites that denounced israel and zionism stating “our main target is zionisme and israhell sic” in november 2014 the group claimed credit for hacking several other university websites in the us with antisemitic and proterror messaging the hackers succeeded in redirecting visitors of some of the websites to pages playing a recording of the quran and featuring a message in english that starts with an antisemitic proterror statement “death to all jews…viva hamas qassam” that same month another group of university websites were hacked to direct visitors to a page featuring antiisrael images and playing a proqassam antisemitic song with the lyrics “teach the son of the jewish woman how many times we will conquer him” in addition to defacing sites in the us and elsewhere with antiisrael messages anonghost often engages in cyberattacks directly targeting israel and israelis indeed there are strong indi­ca­tions that anong­host replaced anony­mous in spear­head­ing the 2015 “opisrael” an annual antiisrael cyberattack campaign previously led by anony­mous and timed to coin­cide with holo­caust remem­brance day while antisemitic themes existed in previous opisrael campaigns it had been primarily billed as a response to the israelipalestinian conflict anonghost’s tactics in the 2015 campaign highlighted the centrality of antisemitism in the campaign during opisrael anonghost claimed it acquired a large amount of personal information about over 200 israelis including phone numbers supposedly associated with whatsapp as well as facebook accounts and made it available to other hackers it then directly targeted israeli individuals by hacking their personal information and sending them antisemitic and threatening text messages on their phones and through other texting platforms such as facebook chat and whatsapp messages muhammed nazmi aka don­nazmi one of the lead­ers of anong­host posted images of what appear to be sam­ples of mes­sages he sent to israelis accord­ing to one image he ini­ti­ated a con­ver­sa­tion with an israeli and once the israeli responded nazmi sent a threat­en­ing mes­sage which included an image of an isis fighter with the cap­tion “we are com­ing o jews to kill you” under the image a mes­sage reads “i am donnazmi blurred from anong­host team send this msg to your gov israel you bet­ter get ready to be pre­pared opis­rael 07042015 is coming” another image posted by nazmi shows a mes­sage that includes what appears to be a per­sonal fam­ily pic­ture sent to a father with his chil­dren cir­cled in red and a cap­tion that reads “i’ll stick a knife in their throats” other anonghost hackers have also shared images of threatening messages they sent to israeli citizens using whatsapp “all your private confidential details are in our hands including your phone numberyour home…we will kill you all of the jewsisraelian sic” another message reads anonghost and anonymous have occasionally taken opposing sides on several issues including the position on isis and competed over leadership positions among hacker groups the rivalry between the two groups has often resulted in them launching cyberattacks against each other the anonghost team appears to be headed by mauritania attacker in an online interview with a hacker’s blog in 2013 mauritania attacker claimed to be a 25 year old male from mauritania who started hacking at a young age by joining teamp0ison and zcompany hacking crew zhc two hacking groups known for their attacks of highprofile targets such as nato nasa the un facebook and the personal email account of former british prime minister tony blair mauritania attacker’s social media accounts are strongly influenced by isis propaganda often including statements videos and photos glorifying isis and its leadership on may 21 2015 he posted a comment in reference to the advancement of isis fighters in iraq on twitter stating “congratulations of the supporters of the islamic state in america for the victories” the comment also included a link to a youtube video of what appears to be an audio message of an isis supporter in michigan the video recording starts with a statement by the speaker saying “we are the supporters of the islamic state in america state of michigan we would like to send you our congratulations for such a great victory the victory of conquering ramadi” his current twitter profile image features the jihadi john the british isis fighter who appeared is several isis beheading videos additionally at one point he gave his location on his twitter profile as “wilayat khorasan” a name given by isis to the muslim region in parts of asia another prominent leader in anonghost who appears to have a high level of technical skills is ungku “prince” in bahasa malaysia” aka muhammad nazmi a malaysiabased male hacker who also expresses radical islamist views in support of isis on his facebook page for example the cover photo of his facebook profile he uses an image depicting isis flag in a battle against the rest of the world flags                  antidefamation

prince mohammad bin salman took his time before congratulating us presidentelect joe biden on his recent election victory this wasn’t a fluke over the course of the past four years the crown prince led a fruitless bombing campaign in yemen may have gotten away with murder and initiated a secret program with china to process uranium progressive members of the us democratic caucus will soon urge biden to abandon the us alliance with saudi arabia but biden should resist this plea abandoning allies rarely leads them to better behavior instead biden should form a coalition of western allies and middle eastern states—including saudi arabia—that gives the united states more leverage to prevent the kingdom from acquiring nuclear weapons and violating human rights republican and democratic members of congress are fed up with saudi arabia last year president donald trump vetoed bipartisan legislation that would have blocked arms sales to the country in response to its bombing campaign in yemen every democrat in congress who voted supported the bill but notably so did trump allies such as republican sen lindsey graham in his criticism of saudi arabia biden has gone even further than most members of congress in november 2019 during a democratic primary debate biden said he “would make it very clear we were not going to … sell more weapons” to saudi arabia which would “make them … the pariah that they are” holding saudi arabia accountable for pursuing nuclear weapons and committing human rights violations makes sense the question is how to do it making the kingdom a pariah state will not curb its nuclear ambitions or its human rights violations if washington wants reform in riyadh it should consider what worries saudi arabia most—abandonment by the united states the saudi government’s fear of abandonment has its roots in the arab spring which began nearly a decade ago at the time the administration of then us president barack obama supported prodemocracy protestors in egypt as ostensible us ally—and dictator—hosni mubarak clung tenuously to power members of the saudi monarchy recognized it was within the realm of possibility that they too could be betrayed saudi anxieties have metastasized since then the iran nuclear deal of 2015 was regarded inside the kingdom as a us attempt to betray saudi arabia and befriend iran riyadh prefers trump to obama in part because trump has ignored its human rights violations and has proved more aggressive against iran but even trump taunts king salman over his country’s dependence on the united states “king—we’re protecting you” he told the leader in 2018 “you might not be there for two weeks without us” if washington wants reform in riyadh it should consider what worries saudi arabia most—abandonment by the united states the recent push in congress to end arms sales to saudi arabia merely cemented riyadh’s fears of abandonment it’s no coincidence then that the crown prince has launched a secret chinesebacked nuclear program and views continued iranian influence in yemen as an existential threat he along with many saudi elites increasingly feels that a relationship with china—particularly one that allows saudi arabia to procure a nuclear weapons arsenal of its own—makes more sense than continued dependence on washington if the united states does not forge a new approach this scenario could easily precipitate a regional nuclear standoff saudi nuclear weapons pointed at iran iranian nuclear weapons aimed at saudi arabia turkey and egypt manufacturing nuclear technologies of their own and israel nervously eyeing its nuclear button if the biden administration makes saudi arabia a pariah state it’s unlikely that the kingdom’s behavior would improve—even if it doesn’t immediately acquire a nuclear bomb the other ussanctioned pariah states—syria iran north korea and cuba—are some of the worst human rights abusers and nuclear proliferators on earth ostracism hasn’t changed them and it won’t change saudi arabia if turning the united states’ back on saudi arabia won’t cool its nuclear weapons ambitions or its human rights violations showing a longterm commitment to the region just might what could ease saudi insecurities is encouraging riyadh to join a new league of western and middle eastern states that cooperate multilaterally on matters of military energy economics and social development even if the coalition started somewhat small—just the united states united kingdom european union saudi arabia and smaller arab states such as jordan oman the united arab emirates bahrain and tunisia—it would demonstrate that the united states and its western allies will not soon leave the kingdom at the mercy of iran or other outside powers this alone should placate riyadh’s fears enough to make nuclear weapons and indiscriminate bombing campaigns far less attractive read more the saudis need to get on biden’s good side obvious places to

training center the pact would train and equip the armed forces of member states to make them more militarily selfsufficient if a member state were to come under attack the west would promise to

renewables natural gas and pipeline projects in the sun and gassoaked middle east these are far cheaper sources of electricity than nuclear power reactors diplomatically the coalition would create a forum for coalition members to settle regional energy and territorial disputes in exchange saudi arabia and other middle eastern coalition members would commit not to withdraw from the 1968 nuclear nonproliferation treaty to forswear activities that could be used to make nuclear explosive materials and to conform to an agreed set of human rights norms for military operations while it may start small the coalition should have grander aspirations israel’s rapprochements with arab states might open the door for it to become the group’s first nonfounding member and the courting of egypt and turkey would follow like the marshall plan’s invitation to the soviet union the door must also remain open for iran to join the group to join however iran—and all other prospective member states in the region—would have to commit to rolling back enrichment or reprocessing activities ceasing military operations against fellow member states and supporting proxy warfare so far tehran has shown no interest in meeting the latter two conditions nonetheless the coalition should highlight the economic advantages of a nonnuclear future and the security benefits of greater restraint in the meantime the pact would enable the sort of multilateral approach that arab states and israel need to effectively counter iranian adventurism finally to make the coalition truly succeed washington must prove the pact can survive regardless of who’s in the white house in an ideal world the us senate would secure the pact as a treaty whether or not that happens congress should fund the united states’ contribution to the pact in perpetuity members of congress might get the ball rolling by penning a bipartisan resolution in support of the plan if saudi arabia were to become convinced that the united states will remain dedicated to stability in the middle east washington would find itself in a far better position to pull riyadh and other capitals away from their worst instincts when it’s all said

349,these are unprecedented times and we’re all facing historic challenges but for the food and beverage industry the threat is nothing short of existential by august of 2020 it was already estimated

100,this document is an archived copy of an older adl report and may not reflect the most current facts or developments related to its subject matter  al qaeda arabic for “the base” is a complex international islamist terrorist network made up of regional affiliate organizations and clandestine cells with varying degrees of communication with osama bin laden and ayman alzawahiri the group’s ideological and operational leaders in order to achieve its ultimate goal of establishing its version of islamic rule across all muslim territory al qaeda continually adopts new patterns of operations in response to global counterterrorism efforts which have in recent years resulted in the capture and death of several of its top commanders in its current incarnation al qaeda relies less on centralized operations such as a hierarchical command structure and training camps instead much of its activities are carried out by independent cells and likeminded organizations with loose ties to its core leadership it has also increased its reliance on the internet for communication and propaganda al qaeda is responsible for executing some of the most deadly terror acts in the past decade including the september 11th attack on new york city and the pentagon the 1998 bombing of two american embassies in east africa and the march 2004 madrid train bombings following the invasions of afghanistan and iraq by american and coalition forces al qaeda has also been associated with much of the terror and guerrilla war in those two nations al qaeda’s core leadership and operatives are made up of veterans of the war against the soviet union’s occupation of afghanistan during the 1980s it is commanded to a degree by osama bin laden and his deputy dr ayman alzawahiri since 1998 al qaeda has operated through a coalition of terror organizations known as the international islamic front for jihad against the jews and crusaders the front was formed to coordinate activities through a council shura led by bin laden at its formation it included bin laden’s al qaeda the egyptian islamic jihad led by zawahiri and other organizations engaged in terrorism around the world the usbacked toppling of the taliban regime in afghanistan following the september 11th terrorist attacks which forced bin laden to go into hiding drastically changed the previously hierarchical nature of al qaeda  veterans of more recent conflicts in particular the wars in the balkans and chechnya make up the second generation of al qaeda commanders who although more loosely affiliated with the central command have helped consolidate al qaeda’s dominance over the global jihad movement al qaeda has also expanded by aligning itself with regional groups including al qaeda in iraq whose leader abu musab alzarqawi the most wellknown insurgent commander in iraq swore allegiance to bin laden  al qaeda also relies on other islamic militants whose talents it can exploit for example khalid sheik mohammed who masterminded the september 11th attacks and mohamed atta leader of the operation’s hamburg cell did not rise through the ranks of the organization by fighting in a guerrilla war instead they were recruited into al qaeda to fill a specific role the alliance was mutually beneficial since these operatives felt that al qaeda was best suited to help them realize their radical ideology and schemes other key figures contracted by al qaeda such as indonesiaborn terrorist riduan isamuddin hambali who is currently held in us custody maintain their independence by not swearing allegiance to bin laden  outside the circle of al qaeda activists and affiliated organizations there are terrorist individuals cells and ad hoc organizations that may have little direct contact with al qaeda operatives but nevertheless carry out attacks in its name for example based on information currently available the attacks on resort towns in the sinai peninsula in egypt taba in october 2004 and sharm el sheik in july 2005 were planned and carried out primarily by locally organized bedouins with no apparent help from the outside yet an organization claiming to be affiliated with al qaeda the abdullah azzam brigades in syria and egypt took responsibility for the attacks which employed tactics characteristic of al qaeda more importantly the sinai attacks as well as a subsequent al qaeda missile attack on american warships in nearby aqaba jordan have in effect opened a new front in the global jihad movement dominated by al qaeda al qaeda’s ideological pull also attracts many wouldbe terrorists including some americans  it is debated exactly how much independent operational capability al qaeda’s central command holds at the present the extent to which it may control and direct the various affiliated or al qaedainspired organizations around the world is unclear some view al qaeda more as a movement than an organization and bin laden as a source of incitement for the international jihad movement rather than its commander but evidence suggests that despite official assessments by the us saudi arabia and pakistan al qaeda’s control in at least some of the fronts in which the global jihad movement is engaged is unbroken and its network of operators still fill important roles in terrorist plots carried by local radicals  al qaeda’s continued capability following the taliban’s demise was underscored as it launched a new terror campaign in 2002 to destabilize saudi arabia relying on its own operatives and command when its high commanders were supposedly on the run a top al qaeda commander moroccan karim mejjati was sent with orders from afghanistan to activate al qaeda cells inside the kingdom al qaeda’s campaign started with the may 2003 attack on a residential complex in riyadh and continued with several bombings and kidnappings mejjati apparently also directed a may 2003 attack in casablanca morocco initially thought to be entirely the work of a local group he was killed in a gun battle with saudi security in march 2005 but speculations regarding other terrorist operations he might have put in motion abound including a possible plan for an attack on us soil where he spent several months between 1997 and 1999  similarly the london bombings on july 7 2005 and a second wave of bombs which did not detonate were initially thought to be the work of homegrown radicals with no substantial outside help or at least no al qaeda connection however evidence suggests that the london bombers were part of an international network connected to al qaeda operatives who were contracted by by the top al qaeda leadership one of the bombers mohammad sidique khan was an al qaeda recruit and in 2001 he met hambali al qaeda’s top operative in southeast asia also based on information obtained by british security agency mi5 from a terrorist caught in pakistan it appears that an al qaedatrained bombmaker azhari bin husin helped make the explosives used in the london attacks husin killed by indonesian forces in november 2005 was involved in a number of al qaeda related attacks around the world in the near term al qaeda seeks to expel westerners specifically americans from historically muslim lands such as iraq saudi arabia and north africa al qaeda has long considered american influence and power to be one of the largest impediments to the establishment of a panislamic nation as they believe it is propping up “apostate” or nonislamic governments in the region  al qaeda’s strategy to drive the us out of muslim lands is to wage an extended campaign of terror causing substantial physical political and economic damage that would force the us to withdraw from the region the central al qaeda leadership however does not have the capability to wage this war by itself rather it depends on local affiliates and allies to strike at us and western interests al qaeda’s leaders believe that the removal of us and western power would significantly weaken and allow them to topple “the apostate rulers” creating a power vacuum which al qaeda and its affiliates could fill this strategy includes not just terror attacks on us interests within the region but around the world including within the us itself al qaeda and its affiliates also attack the “apostate rulers” themselves attempting to weaken them directly and incite islamic revolution  after their shortterm goals are realized and local leaders begin to fall al qaeda seeks to establish islamic rule in their place realizing that not all regimes will fall at the same time it advocates immediately replacing fallen regimes with a religious autocracy similar to the former taliban rule in afghanistan in most cases these governments will be formed by local al qaeda affiliates in conjunction with local leaders who join the al qaeda cause these governments will then be used as foundations for expanding jihadi influence and rule around the region  ultimately al qaeda hopes join all of these separate islamic governments to resurrect the islamic empire known as a caliphate that would rule all muslim lands and fight to expand them al qaeda employs a number of different terrorist tactics including suicide bombing car bombing roadside bombing hijackings and paramilitary operations against civilian and military targets most of the organization’s attacks are wellplanned and often evolve over a number of months if not years one of al qaeda’s most distinguishing tactics is the multiple suicide bombing examples of this are the july 2005 bombings in london and the november 2005 bombings in amman in this type of attack a number of suicide bombers generally two to five coordinate their attacks to strike a number of targets at roughly the same time this tactic not only causes significantly more damage and casualties than a single bomb it also creates a greater sense of panic among victims  al qaeda is also adept at using the media to further its goals its attacks are constantly shown on news channels around the world and its taped messages are broadcast to millions of listeners though most media outlets seek to delegitimize al qaeda they unwittingly spread its message by heavily covering the group’s activities and proclamations bin laden’s personal fortune and a variety of his investments and business partnerships all over the world throughout the years have contributed to the pool of al qaeda funds additionally al qaeda received funding from charities and many forprofit organizations and individuals have been accused of providing funds to the organization in the months after the september 11th terrorist attacks the us government moved to shut down a number of charities including the alharamain foundation and the holy land foundation which allegedly were funding al qaeda other nations too moved to shut down sources of al qaeda funding or money laundering disrupting to an unknown extent the preseptember 11 funding network however al qaeda does not need massive amounts of money to survive after the usled invasion of afghanistan in 2001 and the subsequent destruction of the al qaeda infrastructure there the organization was forced to develop new methods to continue planning conducting and inspiring terror attacks the nowdispersed leadership began relying more heavily on the internet to communicate to its members and the public soon al qaeda shifted many of its activities to cyberspace the internet compensated for the loss of a secure base and allowed al qaeda terrorists to disseminate information and communicate with each other in relative safety al qaeda operates internetbased publications such as muaskar al battar camp of the sword and sawt al jihad the voice of jihad through which it gives general instructions and encourages sympathizers to conduct terrorist activities a quotation from one al battar article illustrates the important role the internet can play in realizing al qaeda’s vision of a loosely connected network working towards the same cause “oh mujahid brother in order to join the great training camps you dont have to travel to other lands alone in your home or with a group of your brothers you too can begin to execute the training program”  since september 2005 a video newscast that claims to be the “voice of al qaeda on the internet” has been posted on the internet as well modeled after standard newscasts the arabiclanguage sout al khilafa arabic for “voice of the caliphate” is divided into segments and employs an anchor who discusses world events and presents stories about terrorist activities against us forces in iraq and in other parts of the world the program also includes video footage of terrorist attacks al qaeda was founded in 1988 by osama bin laden to consolidate the international network he established during the afghan war its goals were the advancement of islamic revolutions throughout the muslim world and repelling foreign intervention in the middle east  bin laden son of a billionaire saudi businessman became involved in the fight against the soviet union’s invasion and occupation of afghanistan which lasted from 1979 to 1988 and ended with a soviet defeat at the hands of international militias of muslim fighters backed by the us saudi arabia and pakistan together with palestinian muslim brotherhood leader abdullah azzam bin laden ran one of seven main militias involved in the fighting they established military training bases in afghanistan and founded maktab al khidamat or services office a support network that provided recruits and money through worldwide centers including in the us  bin laden and azzam had different visions for what to do with the network they had established bin laden decided to found al qaeda based on personal affiliations created during the fighting in afghanistan as well as on his own international network reputation and access to large sums of money the following year azzam was assassinated after the war ended the afghanarabs as the mostly nonafghan volunteers who fought the soviets came to be known either returned to their countries of origin or joined conflicts in somalia the balkans and chechnya this benefited al qaeda’s global reach and later helped cultivate the second and third generations of al qaeda terrorists  following the first gulf war al qaeda shifted its focus to fighting the growing us presence in the middle east particularly in saudi arabia home to islam’s most sacred shrines al qaeda vociferously opposed the stationing of us troops on what it considered the holiest of islamic lands and waged an extended campaign of terrorism against the saudi rulers whom bin laden deemed to be false muslims the ultimate goal of this campaign was to depose the saudi royal family and install an islamic regime on the arabian peninsula the saudi regime subsequently deported bin laden and revoked his citizenship in 1994  in 1991 bin laden moved to sudan where he operated until 1996 during this period al qaeda established connections with other terror organizations with the help of its sudanese hosts and iran while in sudan al qaeda was involved in several terror attacks and guerilla actions carried out by other organizations in may 1996 following us pressure on the sudanese government bin laden moved to afghanistan where he allied himself with the ruling taliban  between 1991 and 1996 al qaeda took part in several major terror attacks al qaeda was involved in the bombing of two hotels in aden yemen which targeted american troops en route to somalia on a humanitarian and peacekeeping mission it also gave massive assistance to somali militias whose efforts brought the eventual withdrawal of us forces in 1994 bin laden was also involved in an assassination attempt against egyptian president hosni mubarak in ethiopia in june 1995 two major terrorist actions against the us military in saudi arabia a november 1995 attack in riyadh and the june 1996 khobar towers bombing also fit al qaeda’s strategy at the time but their connection to al qaeda is not entirely clear there is little evidence to suggest a significant connection between bin laden and the first world trade center bombing in 1993  after moving to afghanistan bin laden escalated his antiamerican rhetoric in an interview with the independent in july 1996 bin laden praised the riyadh and dhahram attacks on us forces in saudi arabia saying it marked “the beginning of war between muslims and the united states” he did not take responsibility for the attacks but said that “not long ago i gave advice to the americans to withdraw their troops from saudi arabia” on august 23 1996 bin laden issued al qaeda’s first “declaration of war” against america his “message from osama bin laden to his muslim brothers in the whole world and especially in the arabian peninsula declaration of jihad against the americans occupying the land of the two holy mosques saudi arabia expel the heretics from the arabian peninsula”  in february 1998 bin laden and several leading muslim militants declared the formation of a coalition called the international islamic front for jihad against the jews and crusaders to fight the us member organizations included al qaeda the egyptian islamic jihad led by dr ayman alzawahiri the egyptian islamic group and organizations engaged in kashmir and bangladesh bin laden was appointed to head the front’s council shura the militants signed a fatwa religious opinion outlining the front’s ideology and goals the fatwa was published in a londonbased arabic paper al quds al arabi it called on all muslims to “kill the americans and their allies  civilians and military” wherever they may be  subsequently al qaeda escalated its war against the us in august 1998 al qaeda bombed two us embassies in east africa nairobi kenya and dar es salaam tanzania killing more than 200 people including 12 americans in retaliation the us attacked targets in sudan and afghanistan in october 2000 al qaeda bombed the uss cole an american guidedmissile destroyer at aden yemen killing 17 american servicemen it committed its most devastating attack on september 11 2001 when 19 al qaeda operatives hijacked four passenger planes and drove two into the twin towers in new york city and one into the pentagon a fourth plane crashed in rural pennsylvania nearly 3000 people were killed in the attack antisemitism the hatred of jews is intrinsic to al qaeda’s ideology and motivation specifically al qaeda’s ideology derives from the particular antisemitism that was developed by the original ideologues of islamist terrorism well before al qaeda was formed according to this theology the ideal man is the muslim holy warrior who is prepared to be martyred for the sake of god and the jews represent his opposite the jews are the muslims’ eternal enemy and unlike the christians cannot be converted or even accommodated as an inferior minority and therefore must be fought until they are annihilated the battles currently being fought by islamic terrorist groups may directly target the us or secular arab regimes but al qaeda considers the jew to be the true evil the opposite image of the true believer in god and the force that commands all other forces fighting islam  despite antisemitism’s central role in al qaeda’s ideology the organization has only attacked distinctly jewish targets since 2002 in the years since al qaeda has also attempted to establish a foothold within israel and the palestinian territories though so far with little success aside from the identification of the targets as “jewish” all the attacks have had additional strategic aims whether it was against the local regime the regime’s ties to israel or global stability in general still the “jewish” identity of the target is not random carrying an important significance to the terrorists themselves  indeed several of the terrorists involved in the september 11th attacks were to a great extent motivated by their hatred toward jews mohamed atta and ramzi binalshibh a key member of the hamburg cell responsible for the attacks considered new york city as the center for a global jewish conspiracy and khalid sheik mohammed who masterminded the attack had previously developed several plans to attack israeli and jewish targets in their view new york as a center of world finance was the quintessential jewish target  al qaeda has been involved in a number of attacks on jewish targets including an attack on a jewish synagogue in tunisia on april 2002 the coordinated bombing of an israeliowned resort and an attempt to down an israeli airliner in mombassa kenya on november 2002 an attack on several jewishassociated targets in casablanca morocco on april 2003 the bombing of two jewish synagogues in istanbul on november 2003 and an attack on several tourist resorts in sinai egypt that are popular with israelis on october 2004 several additional plots around the world have failed  al qaeda has always defined its enemies as the “jews and crusaders” referring even to the american forces in the first gulf war as the “crusaderjewish alliance” bin laden in one of his early public statements which he issued in 1994 also attacked what he considered the saudis’ official endorsement of the oslo peace accord still until 2002 israel and the jews were only on al qaeda’s peripheral view as a strategic target al qaeda was like many in the middle east committed in principal to the liberation of all muslim lands and holy places among these the palestinian areas and the al aksa mosque in jerusalem but it was busier attacking its primary target america and did not direct any recourses toward attacking israel or jews  there are several explanations to what brought al qaeda and its affiliates to change their strategy to include israel and the jewish people among their strategic targets first the terror campaign against jews seems to have been initiated and timed by the leadership as evident from declarations made by al qaeda leaders and spokesmen at first postseptember 11th declarations in support of the palestinians may have been motivated by need for popularity but in 2002 it became apparent that al qaeda had made an ideological and strategic shift making its enmity toward jews more central in a video of bin laden that was shot around the time of al qaeda’s attack on the synagogue in tunisia he declared the war is between us and the jews any country that steps into the same trench as the jews has only herself to blame several months later an al qaeda spokesman expressed a similar idea saying “we will continue to hit america until it gets up and leaves these trenches so that the confrontation can be between us and the jews who are enemies of allah”  another reason for this trend is associated with al qaeda’s relative weakness and its fragmentation following the american invasion of afghanistan al qaeda has relied more on locallybased organizations and often these tend to choose ‘soft targets’ lightlyguarded gathering spots such as night clubs or tourists or buildings associated with the local jewish community attacking jews also has an added propaganda value to al qaeda which relies on the fact that antisemitic feelings are widespread in muslim countries as an example the video of the murder of americanjewish reporter daniel pearl which shows him being beheaded after he “confessed” to being jewish was distributed in saudi arabia and posted to extremist web sites as a way to recruit for al qaeda since al qaeda’s rise to prominence in the 1990’s osama bin laden and al qaeda successfully convinced other leading terrorists groups to ally with the organization in effect this has allowed al qaeda to increase its influence by helping to fund train and direct smaller more regionallyfocused terrorist groups following the toppling of the taliban in 2001 by the us and its subsequent military campaigns in afghanistan al qaeda’s operational methods and capabilities became more decentralized and its ties to other groups became a correspondingly larger aspect of its operations whereas al qaeda had previously planned and executed select missions with its own operatives the destruction of its military headquarters and training camps by the us military forced the organization to turn to other methods al qaeda has thus been able to continue its war against targeted governments by proxy helping to plan attacks actually carried out by operatives from regional groups it is worth noting that there is an ongoing debate as to the amount of influence al qaeda has on its regional allies recent investigations by various governments into terrorist individuals and attacks however have indicated that the organizations listed below are linked to al qaeda it should also be noted that the groups listed below are the largest and most important al qaeda allies but do not constitute a complete list jemaah islamiyah ji is southeast asia’s largest and deadliest terrorist group founded in 1993 the group operates primarily out of indonesia and seeks to overthrow regional governments and replace them with a totalitarian islamic state its ideology and antiwestern rhetoric closely resembles that of al qaeda making the two organizations natural allies it is responsible for many of the indonesia’s most lethal terror attacks including a massive triple suicide bombing outside of a popular nightclub in bali which killed 202 jemaah islamiyah has maintained highlevel ties with al qaeda since the 1990’s and in 1998 thenji leader abdullah sungkar reportedly accepted osama bin laden’s offer to formally ally the two terrorist groups shortly thereafter according to the 911 commission report senior ji leader nurjaman riduan ismuddin aka hambali met with al qaeda leaders khalid sheik mohammed and mohammed atef the two planners of the september 11th terrorist attacks hambali soon began working closely with mohammed and atef to increase ji’s operational capabilities the men reached an arrangement to coordinate attacks whereby ji would scout potential targets and provide supplies in turn al qaeda would provide funding expertise and a number of willing suicide bombers fortunately many of these attacks never came to fruition and hambali was arrested in thailand in 2003 in addition to its assistance in planning attacks in southeast asia al qaeda provided guerrilla training to ji operatives at its camps in afghanistan between 1998 and november 2001 many ji members were trained there including its senior explosive expert dr azahari husin despite the incarceration of several top leaders ji continues to pose a threat to the stability of security of southeast asia particularly indonesia indonesian authorities believe that the organization is behind an october 2005 suicide bombing in bali which killed at least 22 though the extent of coordination between al qaeda and ji in this attack is unknown authorities believe that several of the planners including azahari husin were trained by al qaeda the abu sayyaf group is a small militant islamic organization operating out of the southern philippines where it seeks to establish an islamic state founded around 1990 it is known for its brazen kidnappings and brutal beheadings it has also conducted a number of large attacks on filipino and foreign civilians including a february 2004 bombing of a ferry in manila harbor which killed 194 people prior to 1996 intelligence officials directly linked abu sayyaf with al qaeda alleging that osama bin laden’s brotherinlaw provided the group with startup funding and that abu sayyaf’s first leader aburajak janjalani met with bin laden in pakistan in the early 1990’s additionally intelligence officials believe that abu sayyaf members have trained in al qaeda terrorist camps in afghanistan despite their past cooperation the current operational links between al qaeda and abu sayyaf are unclear according to police reports stemming from recent arrests in the philippines abu sayyaf also trains and coordinates attacks with the al qaedalinked jemaah islamiyah the salafist group for call and combat gspc are the initials for the group’s french name was formed in 1998 as an outgrowth of the oncepowerful and extremely violent groupe islamique armée gia whose popularity drastically declined following a series of massacres in which it killed thousands of algerian civilians repudiating the gia’s brutal tactics a former leader hassan hattab created the gspc hattab declared that the new group would refrain from attacking civilians largely due to this policy the gspc quickly rose to prominence in algerias rural areas where most of its support is located although the gspc has not wholly avoided noncombatants it has eclipsed the gia as the most deadly terrorist organization in algeria it repeatedly attacks the algerian military and also kidnaps western tourists in an effort to weaken and ultimately overthrow the algerian government replacing it with islamic rule based on a pure interpretation of the koran the group is now closely allied with al qaeda from which it receives material and financial support according to french intelligence officials the gspc also maintains close ties with abu musab alzarqawi and his al qaeda in iraq group  members of the organization have stated that that bin laden himself ordered the creation of the group and continues to bankroll it intelligence officials also believe that the two terrorist groups have worked closely on planning major terrorist attacks such as the foiled “millennium plot” to blow up the los angeles airport in addition to its terrorist infrastructure in algeria the gspc has an extensive network of operatives in europe in the past the group has targeted france and in september 2005 it issued a statement threatening the country with more attacks  around the same time a gspc operative in algerian custody divulged information about a cell in france which was allegedly planning to carry out major terrorist attacks on the paris subway orly airport and the headquarters of the french intelligence service  members of the organization have been arrested in major raids in italy france and spain though its significance and ability have gone relatively unnoticed in the international community until recently the moroccan islamic combatant group more commonly known by its french acronym gicm has evolved into one of al qaeda’s most lethal affiliates it espouses the same rigid salafist ideology as al qaeda intelligence services hold the group accountable for several major terrorist attacks including the 2004 madrid train bombings that killed over 190 people and injured at least 1400 they also believe gicm was behind a may 2003 suicide bombing in riyadh saudi arabia in which 20 people were killed in its manifesto the gicm proclaims its intention to fight jews and christians around the world the gicm was founded in the late 1990’s by a group of moroccan islamic militants with the dual goal of overthrowing the moroccan monarchy and supporting al qaeda in its “jihad” against the west european and us intelligence officials claim that the gicm maintains close links with al qaeda according to his purported confession senior gicm member noureddine nfia met with ayman alzawahiri to secure financing and political support nfia currently incarcerated in morocco reportedly described the gicm as a “derivative structure” of al qaeda nfia played a central role in a may 2003 gicm attack on jewish and western targets in casablanca which killed 45 people intelligence services contend that the gicm maintains operatives throughout europe and it is known to be active in belgium italy france spain britain and canada french intelligence is also concerned about the gicm’s links with another al qaeda related organization the algerian salafist group for call and combat gspc al qaeda in iraq was formed shortly after the us invasion of iraq in 2003 by abu musab alzarqawi who initially named the group jamaat altawhid wa aljihad organization of monotheism and jihad the immediate goal of the group was to end the american occupation of iraq by killing americans and their iraqi supporters in october 2004 however zarqawi publicly allied himself with osama bin laden and renamed his organization the al qaeda in iraq the two organizations are known to jointly plot strategies and tactics the group has been responsible for some of the most deadly terrorist attacks in iraq often targeting iraqi police recruits and government officials it has targeted shiites in an attempt to destabilize relations between iraqs sunni and shiite populations and it has also beheaded foreigners including american nick berg it is considered the most dangerous terrorist organization in the country ansar alislam was formed in 2001 by kurdish islamists and militants loyal to osama bin laden who allegedly helps fund the group at its founding the group sought to establish an islamic nation in the kurdish areas of northern iraq but after the us invasion in 2003 ansar alislam shifted its goals to include fighting the us and iraqi governments the group has claimed responsibility for a number of highprofile suicide bombings in iraq in 2001 ansar alislam seized control of a small piece of territory in northern iraq near the iranian border under the direction of its spiritual leader mullah krekar ansar alislam enforced a strict form of islamic rule in its newlyacquired territory shortly thereafter al qaeda operative abu musab alzarqawi joined with ansar alislam and set up a number of alleged terrorist training camps in the area in one of the first operations of the 2003 us invasion of iraq us special forces alongside kurdish partisan fighters attacked and destroyed the ansar alislam headquarters in the village of sargat in march 2003 the us has claimed that soldiers found evidence of an incipient chemical weapons program in the village krekar was arrested in norway in 2004 and is awaiting extradition to iraq since 2003 jaish ansar alsunna arabic for army of the followers of the teachings has carried out some of the most lethal terrorist attacks in iraq including many suicide bombings in an effort to achieve its ultimate goal of establishing a fundamentalist islamic government in the country among the deadliest attacks claimed by ansar alsunna is a bombing in erbil that killed 109 people in february 2004 and a suicide bombing at a us military base near mosul that killed 22 people including 14 us soldiers the group described by us officials as the principal organized terrorist adversary in iraq follows a salafist ideology and has attracted followers within iraqi as well as supporters worldwide ansar alsunna grew out of ansar alislam a militant kurdish islamic group founded by kurdish cleric mullah krekar in 2001 to establish an islamic government in iraq according to us and iraqi intelligence officials a schism between members of ansar alislam coupled with the deaths of many of its leaders following the us invasion of iraq led to the formation of the ansar alsunna in september 2003 ansar alsunna also maintains strong links with al qaeda and its leader in iraq abu musab alzarqawi who joined ansar alsunna after fleeing afghanistan in 2001 the full extent of their links is unclear however captured members of ansar alsunna have reportedly described zarqawi as having a leadership role in the group some ansar alsunna followers have also reportedly described a rift between their leaders and zarqawi it is clear however that ansar alsunna and al qaeda maintain some sort of operational links lashkaretaiba army of the pure is a pakistanibased islamic terrorist organization which seeks to drive out indian forces from the jammu and kashmir region of south asia and establish an islamic caliphate the organization was founded in the 1980’s under the direction of both osama bin laden and the pakistani government which also opposes the indian presence in kashmir as the armed wing of the markaz dawa alirshad an islamic social welfare group intelligence services consider let to be the most hardcore of the kashmirbased islamic militant groups and it is known for its many deadly attacks including a daring raid on the indian parliament in 2002 which killed 14 intelligence services have discovered a number of direct operational links between let and al qaeda which are allies in bin laden’s international islamic front iif before its camps in afghanistan were destroyed by the united states in 2001 al qaeda frequently hosted and trained let operatives who went on to fight in kashmir conversely since the destruction of those camps let has hosted al qaeda trainees including shahzad tanweer one of the suicide bombers in the july 7 2005 london underground attack additionally senior al qaeda leaders such as abu zubeida have been arrested at let compounds and let operatives have reportedly been recruited for planned al qaeda attacks on american interests let is known for its expertise in suicide bombing and conventional assault tactics it is alleged by numerous intelligence officials that let has members around the world

the islamic movement of uzbekistan is a conglomeration of islamic militants from throughout central asia the imu’s stated goal is to overthrow the current uzbek regime and establish an islamic state throughout central asia the group aims to achieve this objective by conducting terrorist activities including suicide bombings kidnappings and shootings in uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan its rhetoric is antiamerican and antisemitic and it has targeted westerners in past terrorist operations the imu is closely linked with al qaeda and osama bin laden allegedly helps fund the group members of the imu have also reportedly been placed in leadership roles within al qaeda and many have served as a type of defense force for senior al qaeda leaders though us operations in afghanistan

134,hamas formed in late 1987 at the beginning of the first palestinian intifada uprising its roots are in the palestinian branch of the muslim brotherhood and it is supported by a robust sociopolitical structure inside the palestinian territories the groupâs charter calls for establishing an islamic palestinian state in place of israel and rejects all agreements made between the plo and israel hamasâ strength is concentrated in the gaza strip and areas of the west bank hamas has a military wing known as the izz aldin alqassam brigades that has conducted many antiisrael attacks in both israel and the palestinian territories since the 1990s these attacks have included largescale bombings against israeli civilian targets smallarms attacks improvised roadside explosives and rocket attacks the group in early 2006 won legislative elections in the palestinian territories ending the secular fatah partyâs hold on the palestinian authority and challenging fatahâs leadership of the palestinian nationalist movement hamas continues to refuse to recognize or renounce violent resistance against israel and in early 2008 conducted a suicide bombing killing one civilian as well as numerous rocket and mortar attacks that have injured civilians the us government has designated hamas a foreign terrorist organization hamas in june 2008 entered into a sixmonth agreement with israel that significantly reduced rocket attacks following the temporary calm hamas resumed its rocket attacks which precipitated a major israeli military operation in late december 2008 after destroying much of hamasâ infrastructure in the gaza strip israel declared a unilateral ceasefire on 18 january 2009 hamas and fatah in april 2011 agreed to form an interim government and hold elections reaffirming this pledge in february 2012 hamas departed its longtime political headquarters in damascus in february and dispersed throughout the region as syrian president bashar alasadâs crackdown on opposition in the country made remaining in syria untenable for the group in may 2012 hamas claimed to have established a 300strong force to prevent other palestinian resistance groups from firing rockets into israel conflict broke out again in november while hamas had worked to maintain the ceasefire brokered by egypt that ended the weeklong conflict other palestinian militant groups flouted the ceasefire with sporadic rocket attacks throughout 2013 and 2014 fatah and hamas in april 2014 agreed to form a technocratic unity government headed by pa prime minister rami hamdallah and to hold legislative elections within six months hamas has not renounced violent resistance against israel even while pursuing reconciliation with fatah in july 2014 the uneasy calm between hamas and israel broke down completely after three israeli teenagers were kidnapped and killed in the west bank in juneâdeaths ascribed by israel to hamasâand a palestinian was killed by israeli settlers in revenge retaliatory rocket attacks by hamasâs military wing and other palestinian militants in the gaza strip escalated into the longest and most lethal conflict with

been shut off due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak fabrice coffriniafp via getty images the world health organization who has played a controversial role in the global response to the coronavirus pandemic  us president donald trump has accused the organization of being too close to china and moved to withdraw the united states from it  at the same time the who is helping coordinate the international rollout of potential vaccines and treatments for covid19 as the who holds its 73rd world health assembly – remotely this year due to the pandemic – here is a look at how people in 14 advanced economies viewed the organization’s initial covid19 response based on surveys conducted in june through august by pew research center this analysis focuses on how people in 14 advanced economies viewed the world health organization’s response to the coronavirus outbreak earlier this year the analysis is based on nationally representative surveys of 14276 adults conducted from june 10 to aug 3 2020 it’s important to note that this was a time when the pandemic appeared to be receding across europe and much of the us surveys were conducted over the phone with adults in the us canada belgium denmark france germany italy the netherlands spain sweden the uk australia japan and south korea here are the questions used for this report along with responses and its methodology  the study was conducted in countries where nationally representative telephone surveys are feasible due to the coronavirus outbreak facetoface interviewing is not currently possible in many parts of the world in most surveyed countries majorities approved of the who’s handling of the pandemic though there were some notable exceptions a median of 63 of adults across 14 nations said this summer that the who had done a good job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak in 12 of these countries half or more thought the who had managed the pandemic well japan and south korea – two early hotspots for the virus – were notable outliers only about a fifth of south koreans 19 and a quarter of japanese 24 were convinced the who had dealt with the pandemic well in may south korean president moon jaein pushed for the organization to be tougher on member nations  particularly with regard to sharing data about the virus and japanese deputy prime minister taro aso has panned the organization for its close ties to china  a nation viewed negatively by nearly nineinten japanese  people in most surveyed countries were more likely to approve of their own nation’s handling of the pandemic than the who’s response but that wasn’t the case everywhere in sweden belgium france and the us similar shares said their country and the who had done a good job elsewhere more said the who had handled the outbreak well than said the same of their own country the survey was conducted in summer before a second surge in coronavirus cases began across europe in the uk fewer than half 46 said their own country had done a good job dealing with the virus but 64 said the same about the who similarly in spain 54 said their country had dealt with the virus well but twothirds said the same of the who americans have grown slightly more positive about the who’s handling of the pandemic only 53 of americans said this summer that the organization had handled the outbreak well but that represented an increase since the spring  when only 46 said this democrats and independents who lean democratic were more likely than republicans and republican leaners to assess the who’s pandemic response positively seveninten democrats said the organization had done a good job dealing with the outbreak compared with only 32 of republicans there was a similar partisan divide in the spring but the share of democrats who rated the who’s response positively increased by 8 percentage points by summer from 62 to 70 in all surveyed nations those who have a favorable opinion of the united nations were more likely to think the who – which is part of the un – had done a good job dealing with the virus in australia for example 69 of adults with a favorable view of the un saw the who’s handling of the pandemic as effective compared with only 26 of those with an unfavorable opinion of the un in some countries including the us political ideology and support for political parties were also connected with views of the who in half the countries surveyed those on the left of the ideological spectrum were more likely than those on the right to think the who had handled the pandemic well similarly europeans who support leftwing populist parties were more likely to think the who had done a good job managing the outbreak when compared with those who do not support these parties conversely supporters of some rightwing populist parties were less likely than nonsupporters to think the organization’s response to the coronavirus outbreak had been effective in most surveyed countries women and younger adults were more likely to say the who had handled the virus well the gender divide was largest in italy where twothirds of women said this summer that the organization had been effective in dealing with the pandemic compared with fewer than half of men 44 similarly in nine countries adults ages 18 to 29 were more likely than those 50 and older to say the who had done a good job dealing with the outbreak for example in the us 68 of younger adults said the who’s response to the outbreak had been effective compared with only 49 of older adults note here are the questions used for this report along with responses and its methodology  topics,3
35,the islamic state of iraq and the levant is a terrorist organization   that has exploited the conflict in syria and sectarian tensions in iraq   to entrench itself in both countries isil’s stated goal is   to solidify and expand its control of territory once ruled by early   muslim caliphs and to govern through implementation of its strict   interpretation of sharia the group’s strength and   expansionary agenda pose an increasing threat to us regional allies and   us facilities and personnel in the middle east as well as in the west isilâformerly known as alqa‘ida in iraq and later the islamic state of iraqâwas established in april 2004 by abu mus‘ab alzarqawi who pledged his group’s   allegiance to usama bin ladin the group targeted coalition and iraqi   forces and civilians to pressure foreigners to leave iraq reduce iraqi   popular support for the us and iraqi government and attract recruits   the group suffered a series of setbacks starting in 2007âresulting from the combination of sunni civilian resistance and a surge in coalition and iraqi government operations against the groupâbefore rebounding in late 2011 after coalition forces withdrew amid growing sunni discontent with the shiadominated iraqi government while gaining strength in iraq isil also expanded its presence in syria and established alnusrah front as a cover for its activities there disputes over the group’s strategic direction in syria led to conflict and ultimately isil’s disavowal by alqa‘ida in february 2014 setting the stage for isil’s subsequent challenge to alqa‘ida for leadership of the global extremist movement in june 2014 isil unilaterally declared the establishment of an   islamic caliphate and called on all muslims to pledge allegiance to the   group since then isil has announced the establishment of eight   provinces outside of iraq and syria including in afghanistan and   pakistan algeria the caucasus egypt libya saudi arabia west   africa and yemen it has also continued to attract a large number of   foreigners to iraq and syriaâincluding thousands of westernersâto take part in the group’s campaign of violence and help the “caliphate” grow  isil’s vast territorial safe haven in iraq and syria   access to western foreign fighters and substantial financial resources   pose a persistent and growing threat to the united states since   september 2014 isil’s leadership has issued multiple   public calls for attacks against us and western interests around the   world and the group has made similar calls for attacks in its englishlanguage magazine dabiq isil members and sympathizers have responded by planning or conducting attacks at an unprecedented paceâat least 37 plots between february 2014 and july 2015 isil is also known as da’esh or da’ish an acronym for its name in arabic it is currently led by abu bakr albaghdadi also known as abu du’a the group was designated as a foreign terrorist organization on 17 december 2004

60,20201125  on 26 september hundreds of malian women and some men rallied in bamako to protest against the trivialisation of violence against women this was prompted by the revelation on social media of alleged intimate partner abuse involving a famous malian artist the story broke just two months before the 25 november annual international day for the elimination of violence against women the case now pending in court sheds light on a societywide problem that’s often silenced by deeply entrenched social norms and religious discourse fear on the part of the political elite to confront the divisive issue makes matters worse official figures on violence against women are hard to find in mali – even more so specific numbers on domestic and intimate partner violence the country’s statistical capacities are generally weak but this also indicates the low priority given to issues affecting women especially genderbased violence the little data that is available including through humanitarian protection monitoring mechanisms emphasises conflictrelated sexual and genderbased violence this should be tracked and addressed as mali struggles with a multidimensional crisis in its central and northern regions but violence against women goes beyond this conflict despite repeated appeals for reform there’s been little progress on improving women’s lives and rights in a 2017 interview then chair of the national chapter of women in law and development in africa bouaré bintou founé samaké said 85 of the violence against women cases the organisation documented occurred in family settings samaké now heads the ministry in charge of women’s affairs in the transitional government which opens new possibilities for action a 2018 national institute of statistics demographic and health survey showed that one in two malian women aged 15 to 49 had suffered acts of physical or sexual violence the same proportion faces emotional physical andor sexual abuse in the context of relationship breakups the survey also found that 79 of women and 47 of men considered physical violence by a man against his female partner to be normal and justifiable women’s organisations have been vocal about the widespread nature of violence against women but despite their repeated appeals for reforms there’s been little progress towards improving the country’s framework to protect women’s lives and rights a 2019 draft law opposing violence against women proposed by women’s and other civil society organisations wasn’t adopted partly due to pressure by powerful religious groups to many this felt like déjàvu in 2009 the national assembly of mali had passed a family law that leaned towards improving women’s rights and advancing gender equality but this law was never enacted by the executive pressure from religious groups led the administration of then president amadou toumani touré to send the text back to parliament the version signed by the executive two years later removed all progressive dispositions for women’s rights a 2019 draft law on violence against women wasn’t adopted partly due to pressure by religious groups the september 2020 protest revived an old conversation on societal factors excusing violence against women and the legal vacuum protecting perpetrators this created an opportunity for transition authorities to do the right thing on 1 october the transition charter was released setting out the steps and priorities of the 18month transition following the august coup given the complexity of the crisis and the limited timeframe choices had to be made and gender inequality wasn’t included in the roadmap’s six priority areas nonetheless by enacting longoverdue policies and laws that improve the safety of millions of women and girls reform can be achieved during the transition political courage will be needed to carry an agenda of social justice and women’s rights in a country where this routinely triggers resistance by powerful conservative forces in october the appointment of an 84 male transitional government by an allmale leadership was met with criticism it fell short of the obligation in a 2015 law to include at least 30 of each sex in any nominations for public office the backlash led to the transitional government making the inclusion of women a requirement for all groups to be represented in the national transitional council the council will probably involve a higher proportion of women than any previous legislature in mali’s history this creates a unique opportunity to raise issues affecting women on the national agenda a social justice and women’s rights agenda triggers resistance by powerful conservative forces however more women in the legislature won’t necessarily translate into greater gender equality in the country’s laws these women will need to drive a violence against women agenda which calls for a clear sense of purpose determination and support from women’s organisations and male allies in and outside government without a specific law on violence against women victims have few options to seek justice especially as society stigmatises those who speak up there is also nothing to deter perpetrators passing a law would help fight impunity but it won’t be enough effective implementation must follow including in oftenoverlooked rural areas women will need to be made aware of their rights and political leadership and drive will be essential to getting justice and security personnel on board this will take profound mindset changes in institutional cultures that have minimised violence against women as a ‘private’ issue such shifts are only possible if political commitment to improve the safety status and overall conditions of women remains high the transition period could set the tone and create a new norm for subsequent governments to live by transitional authorities should champion the agenda for better representation of women in all areas of public service this means observing the 30 minimum requirement in appointments during the transition and paving the way for it to be mandatory in the revised electoral framework it means reviewing public administration recruitment practices to increase the presence of women and offer them better career prospects measures are also needed to improve girls’ access to advanced education that prepares them for leadership positions addressing violence against women in mali will require more than a law society’s views on women need to change and the structural power imbalances between women and men must be rectified to achieve this girls need better access to education and women need incomegenerating opportunities and representation in all areas of public and private sectors including leadership

87,prodemocracy protesters in thailand have confronted a motorcade carrying members of the royal family as it passed through a rally in bangkok the protesters who were pushed back by ranks of police raised the threefinger salute that has become a symbol of the protest movement they have called for curbs on the kings powers and for the resignation of prime minister prayuth chanocha the protests on wednesday follow months of escalating tension in the country the peaceful confrontation happened on wednesday evening as queen suthida was travelling in a motorcade on the streets of bangkok after attending a buddhist ceremony at the grand palace as her car passed by a crowd of protesters chanted and raised their hands in the threefinger salute the gesture is thought to have been inspired by the hunger games films in which it is used as a symbol of unity and defiance earlier in the afternoon the king and queen had travelled together without incident to the grand palace along ratchadamnoen avenue where demonstrations had took place earlier in the day most of the protesters had moved out of the site by the time their motorcade went past leaving royalists along the route supporters of the monarchy dressed in tshirts in royal yellow colour staged rival protests in the capital with some filmed violently attacking the prodemocracy protesters some witnesses accused the government of disguising police as royalist demonstrators the two sides had gathered separately along ratchadamnoen avenue on wednesday afternoon and were kept largely apart by police the antigovernment protesters linked arms and marched chanting prayuth get out  referring to the prime minister  and long live the people the protesters were prevented from reaching government house by what appeared to be ranks of royalist supporters wearing yellow tshirts who linked arms and shouted insults at the protesters  we want to show that we love the king 47yearold sirilak kasemsawat told afp news agency accusing the prodemocracy movement of wanting to overthrow the monarchy  a charge the movement has always denied were not asking them to be toppled forgotten or not to be respected said dear thatcha a prodemocracy protester were just asking them to change with us our country needs to adapt to many things and the monarchy is one of the issues that needs to be adapted as well she said the growing studentled protest movement which began in july has become the greatest challenge in years to thailands ruling establishment protests over the weekend in the capital were some of the largest in years with thousands defying authorities to gather and demand change authorities say 18000 people joined saturdays demonstration although others gave higher figures many stayed to continue the protest into sunday before dispersing the protesters calls for royal reform are particularly sensitive in thailand where criticism of the monarchy is punishable by long prison sentences ratchadamnoen avenue  literally the kings walk  has been the scene of many of thailands political battles this afternoon the studentled antigovernment movement managed to occupy democracy monument the art deco sculpture which symbolises the end of the absolute monarchy 88 years ago  but this time large numbers of royalist demonstrators in yellow tshirts lined the boulevard with members of the security forces conspicuous among them for the first time since these protests began in july king vajiralongkorn is in bangkok at the same time and his motorcade was due to travel down ratchadamnoen the potential for violence was real police sources said they were at their highest threat level a few flowerpots were thrown in some brief skirmishes around the monument but for the most part both sides showed great restraint and the antigovernment side was allowed to march unchallenged  they chanted reformist mantras and revolutionary slogans on their way to the office of the prime minister  by now thoroughly barricaded by concrete and razor wire  and the risk of a clash and a royal embarrassment was averted  but the demands of younger protesters in particular that the monarchy be made accountable to elected institutions are undiluted and expressed with breathtaking frankness when you consider the price paid by royal critics in the past this constitution like all its predecessors states at the top that the king must be held in a position of revered worship  these protesters are adamant this must change that such a wealthy powerful and expensive institution must be accountable the government is equally adamant that the monarchy cannot be discussed at some point something will have to crack  thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest but a new wave began in february after a court ordered a fledgling prodemocracy opposition party to dissolve the future forward party ffp had proved particularly popular with young firsttime voters and garnered the thirdlargest share of

and government have denied since july there have been regular studentled street protests  demonstrators have demanded that the government headed by prime minister prayuth a former army chief who seized power in the coup be dissolved that the constitution be rewritten that the authorities stop harassing critics the student daring to challenge thailandâs monarchy why a new generation of thais

106,neturei karta nk an international ultraorthodox antizionist group with a strong base of support in the us views itself as the religious jewish authority on zionism and israel and claims to “pray for the peaceful dismantlement of the state of israel” founded in 1938 “neturei karta” aramaic for “guardians of the gates” opposes the contemporary state of israel because it does not believe that the jewish people have the right to selfdetermination and because only god can restore jewish sovereignty in the land of israel by bringing the messiah nk has a very extreme agenda and has regularly aligned with international antisemites islamic extremists and groups that advocate violence against israel in recent years leaders of neturei karta have met with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on several occasions in new york and tehran as well as leaders of hamas in gaza and hezbollah in lebanon the group’s participation in a “holocaust review” conference in tehran in december 2006 which was attended by a host of international holocaust deniers demonstrated the group’s willingness to meet with the vilest of extremists in 2012 leaders of neturei karta met with highranking hezbollah officials on at least two occasions in march several nk leaders participated in a “global march to jerusalem” and laid a wreath at the tomb of hezbollah terrorist imad mugniyeh then in june some of

during the global march to jerusalem in 2012 18 ahmadinejad while he was in new york during the un general assembly in september of that year neturei karta’s association with these groups for photo ops and discussions about israel and zionism – in which they dress in traditional hasidic garb and are often described simply as “jewish rabbis” – indicate the lengths neturei karta is willing to go to prop up israel’s enemies indeed neturei karta leaders have even called on the jewish community to dialogue with hamas and apologize for “stealing their land” leaders of neturei karta specifically dovid feldman and yisroel dovid weiss the north american spokesperson for nk display a commitment to proving to international muslim and arab audiences that jews don’t support israel both appear regularly for interviews on aljazeera and press tv iran’s governmentrun english language satellite news network in an interview with al jazeera in march 2012 weiss claimed “zionism has created rivers of bloodthis is against the will of the almighty and this is not what it means to be a jew” this has led the more mainstream ultraorthodox community to join the broader jewish community to disavow and repudiate neturei karta indeed neturei karta’s views are not in any way representative of the vast majority of the jewish community while these denouncements are important it is still likely that the average passerby who witnesses neturei karta’s participation at an antiisrael protest surmises that many jews who dress similarly agree with this position and while it is true that the ultraorthodox community largely disapproves of israel’s secular government and liberal policies the vast majority thoroughly abhors and rejects neturei karta’s ideology neturei karta’s leaders in the us most of whom are based in brooklyn and monsey new york regularly participate in antiisrael demonstrations in order to lend a jewish face to the protest in interviews and at these events nk leaders have not held back in their vitriolic rhetoric against the state of israel describing israelis as nazis calling israel a “cancer” and accusing zionists of controlling the media while neturei karta’s primary motto can be boiled down to “judaism does not equal zionism” leaders of the group also allege that a jewish person’s support for zionism essentially strips him of his jewishness during a protest outside a speech by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu at the council on foreign relations’ new york office in july 2010 members of neturei karta chanted “netanyahu is not a jew” nk leaders participate in a range of antiisrael programs and events on campus including weeklong 19 programs like israeli apartheid week protests that took place during israel’s “operation pillar of defense” in november 2012 and as the jewish representatives at “interfaith” events about israelpalestine organized by propalestinian student groups on campus recent activity 2018 representatives of neturai karta met with hezbollah in lebanon and presented a gift for hassan nasrallah 2017 representatives of neturai karta attended propalestinian conference in tehran in which iran’s supreme leader ayatollah

46,main menu damien spleeters  share via     abstract despite domestic prosecutors facing a growing problem of connecting the provision of remote technical expertise with criminal activities in foreign conflict zones the work of conflict armament research’s car field investigators recently aided the prosecution of haisem zahab an australian citizen zahab had been researching rockets and rocket guidance systems as well as other technologies and passed at least some of his findings to the islamic state in iraq and syria while the prosecution was not in a position to prove the group used zahab’s work to concretely advance its weapons productions efforts it sought to argue that this could have happened in drawing on car’s extensive documentation and analysis of islamic state rockets australian federal police were able to show parallels between zahab’s designs and islamic state production lines and to secure his guilty plea the factory floor was silent save for the click of the author’s camera’s shutter and the wary shuffling of iraqi rapid response division soldiers manning the sector working his way through the repurposed former cement factory the author documented any item of relevance to the islamic state’s vast and sophisticated weapons production program the group had converted the site in al arij to mosul’s south into an expansive rocket production facility before iraqi government forces drove them out relics of islamic state production lines could still be seen in the machinery now abandoned and idle the author photographed a threadcutting machine a large metal lathe a sheet metal roller a notcher that cuts steel and several work benches then there on the ground the author found rocket motors warhead cases in various stages of completion fins and nozzles the author’s organization conflict armament research car whose job it is to trace illicit weapons flows had already extensively documented different types of islamic stateproduced rockets since 20151 it was february 2 2017 and while this factory was no longer operational elsewhere the islamic state still manufactured rockets by the thousands three weeks later and thousands of miles away australian federal police afp arrested haisem zahab who would turn out to be providing information to the islamic state for its weapons production efforts car’s investigations of islamic state rocket production manifested in an expert witness statement and testimony to the prosecution would ultimately help secure a guilty plea this article first examines the haisem zahab case and the ways in which car assisted the prosecution zahab designed a laser warning receiver to alert to incoming missile strikes2 and later researched and developed rockets and rocket propellant3 while zahab communicated at least some of the technical details of his work to the islamic state it is difficult to determine whether the group used any of his findings to concretely advance their weapons production program however as this article will show the commonalities afp found between his research and development and the islamic state’s production on the ground—as documented by car—render this a possibility this is precisely what the prosecution sought to demonstrate4 the author will then delve deeper into car’s wider findings about the islamic state’s weapons programs and show how they were akin to an ‘industrial revolution of terrorism’ with centralized management quality control standardization of production and division of labor as car investigators deployed on the ground have found the islamic state’s military production effort was propelled by the group’s efforts at research and development as the zahab case shows individuals compelled by the call of the ‘caliphate’ felt the need to contribute to these efforts even from afar car’s assistance with the haisem zahab case afp arrested5 haisem zahab in the early hours of february 28 2017 in young australia a sleepy town of less than 10000 people best known for its annual cherry festival this arrest marked the conclusion of operation marksburg named—like every afp counter terrorism investigation—after a famous castle an australian citizen zahab who was 42 at the time6 was charged with “intentionally providing support or resources to a terrorist organization namely islamic state knowing that the organization was a terrorist organization”7 he had been designing a laser warning receiver that informs of incoming missile strikes and had been researching and developing rockets rocket propellant and rocket guidance systems as well as creating reports videos and tutorials based on his work8 at a press conference organized on the day of the arrest then australian prime minister malcolm turnbull commented that zahab “had sought to advise isil on how to develop hightech weapons capability”9 then afp commissioner andrew colvin added that the police believed zahab had “networks and contacts in isil – not necessarily just in the conflict zones but in other parts of the world as well and he has been relying on them to pass this information”10 the evidence afp gathered on zahab even if printed doublesided would have been enough to fill hundreds of shipping containers11 zahab was not a foreign fighter but even past cases built on foreign fighter returnees have been dismissed because the prosecution failed to tie them to the realities of the conflict against the islamic state that raged in iraq and syria between 2014 and 201812 as car noted at the time13 “domestic prosecutors face a growing problem of connecting the provision of remote technical expertise with criminal activities in conflict zones”14 this time the afp and australia’s federal prosecution service—the commonwealth director of public prosecutions—wanted to maximize their chances of successfully prosecuting zahab from the evidence found on zahab’s electronic devices and from the communications he had with individuals connected to the islamic state the prosecution was confident they could prove the extent of his research and the fact that he had sought to transfer the fruit of his work to the islamic state however the prosecution was keen to show that zahab had not been working in isolation but knew his research would interest the group australian investigators wanted to see whether there were any correlations between the designs found on zahab’s computer and those built and used by islamic state so they contacted car a research organization that had been extensively documenting islamic state military production in iraq and syria since 201415 founded in 2011 car sends investigators to conflicts around the world working in more than 20 different countries there investigators work with defense and security forces to gain access to all recovered weapons ammunition and associated material in order to thoroughly document them through the subsequent tracing of chains of custody car identifies vectors and hubs of diversion car’s database of diverted weapons and ammunition amounts to more than half a million distinct items between 2014 and 2018 car deployed its field investigation teams across frontline positions against islamic state forces documenting more than 40000 items recovered from the islamic state investigators covered the full extent of the frontline from the northern syrian city of kobane to the south of the iraqi capital baghdad16 excluding travel and logistics the teams spent many hundreds of days physically inspecting and documenting weapons across the region performing more than 100 site documentations17 and visiting dozens of workshop where islamic state forces manufactured filled stored repaired modified or otherwise developed weapons and ammunition once afp had established that car held information potentially useful to the prosecution it sought to determine whether the evidence could be used in a court of lawa this was indeed determined to be the case and over five days in june 2018 car provided the afp with a 200page statement with evidentiary photos videos and 3d laser scans a few months later zahab pleaded guilty to the charges18 car then provided expert testimony at the parramatta supreme court sentencing hearing in may 2019 car’s statement and court testimony proved instrumental to the prosecution in showing similarities between zahab’s research and the islamic state’s production as well as the scale of the latter’s program the following month the court sentenced zahab to nine years in a highsecurity penitentiary19 the sentence handed down on june 7 2019 includes a statement of facts agreed between zahab’s defense and the prosecution that relies heavily on the statement car provided in the way it portrays islamic state weapon production and the similarities found between the group’s work and zahab’s research20 the statement of facts paints a portrait of a selftaught engineer obsessed by his research into rocketry and eager to share with the islamic state what he had learned from the internet and his own experimentations starting in june 2015 and continuing until april 2016 “in the late hours of the evening and early morning at his residential address”21 zahab researched the manufacture and performance of rocket propellant mixtures this included “conducting flights of hobby rockets to test the accuracy … of a computer software that designs and simulates rockets” “designing unguided rockets” using this computer software and conducting research and development on “guidance for rockets using gps”22 during this period zahab “also generated a number of written reports and a video regarding his research and development into rockets and guidance systems”23 zahab started by saving computeraideddrawing cad files of hobbysized rocket bodies and nose cones on his computer to amend them and make his own versions24 later on zahab began researching rocket propellant and other explosive precursors such as ammonium nitrate according to court documents25 he created a written report titled “how to make ammonium nitrate using house hold chemicals” consisting of instructions on how to make ammonium nitrate from various offtheshelf chemicals as well as how to obtain it from fertilizer or instant cold packs based on several youtube videos wherein zahab noted that it was “cheaper to buy ammonium nitrate but that ‘our’ objective was to explore the chemistry” in this document zahab also explored ways to produce ammonium perchlorate and potassium perchlorate—two powerful advanced rocket propellant precursors—drawing from a 2012 blog post and a youtube video26 his first rocket models were partially based on existing military designs such as the soviet 9m22u 122 mm rocket which is often colloquially referred to as a ‘grad’ rocket though the term ‘grad’ should apply to the soviet bm21 truckmounted multiple rocket launcher system car investigators have observed that state and nonstate forces in iraq and other theaters would often refer to large rockets as ‘grad’ even if they were not the 9m22u model in june 2016 car documented a ledger in an islamic state weapon production facility in fallujah referring to the production and testing of ‘grad’ rockets27 judging by zahab’s drawings28 however the similar features between them and the 9m22u rocket may have been limited to their diameter zahab created his first designs on the computer modeling and simulation software ‘openrocket’ one of these designs had a diameter of 122 millimeters a length of 312 centimeters a payload of five kilograms and a range of eight kilometers other designs would be created with a larger payload he created documents detailing his designs’ “measurements capable altitude flight time speed and the material type and composition for each section of the rocket”29 zahab later wrote another report in which he adjusted some of the designs to plot a flight course from a designated launch point to the syrian town of sarrin which at the time august 2015 was contested between kurdish and islamic state forces in the report zahab provided information on this particular rocket model’s grain propellant and advice on finding the right fuel propellant to match the data and ensure the model’s accuracy30 the court documents do not reveal whether or not investigators believe zahab sent this particular report to the islamic state he did however send previous reports to the group via electronic communicationb such as a 288page technical report on a laser warning receiver he had built and tested31 the laser warning receiver was designed to pick up the laser signal used to ‘paint’ a target before a missile strike32 on zahab’s computer’s bash history which is the file containing previous commands entered by a user the police found an encoded message referring to the 288page technical report on the laser warning receiver33 in this message zahab wrote that he managed to get in touch with an “administrator” thanks to a third party who showed pictures of zahab’s work to a “tech team” for analysis the “administrator” asked why zahab wasn’t here and how they could communicate with him if he wasn’t here zahab explained his situation and the administrator requested a full report from him he said he wanted to help the “techies” and liaise with them for development but that was not possible because zahab had to understand he was dealing not with a single person but with a “corporation”34 while it is not explicitly revealed in the court documents that the “administrator” was part of the islamic state setup in syriairaq this can be inferred from their communications quoted above furthermore in zahab’s sentencing document it is stated “he zahab agreed that once he had compiled his report in relation to the receiver he sent it to islamic state with the intention of assisting that organisation”35 afp alleged that zahab also sent this 288page report to a uk national samata ullah36 who was arrested in september 2016 in the united kingdom uk investigators found zahab’s report in the digital evidence seized from ullah37 ullah pleaded guilty of the offenses of ‘membership of a proscribed organisation’ ‘terrorist training’ ‘preparation of terrorist acts’ and two counts of ‘possession of an article for terrorist purposes’38 ullah was sentenced in the united kingdom in may 2017 to eight years in prison at the time the head of the british metropolitan police counter terrorism command stated ullah had “set up a selfhelp library for terrorists around the world and they were using his library … we know the islamic state was using that material to both seek guidance and instruction”39 most of the information gathered by zahab in instructional reports on experimental rocketry fuel burn rates rocket propellants motor thrust data and motor designs came from the internet zahab used mobile phone applications “to measure degrees and radians” and he even studied computer coding languages such as java and python to model a guided rocket and “study the effects on fin changes gravity and target gps acquisition”40 indeed zahab researched gps guidance systems for his munition designs he studied how to steer the munition once it would reach its apogee and begin descent on to its target41 to test his simulations zahab purchased readymade hobby rocket engines on ebay42 used a cad designing software to create files of “outer casings for various different sized hobby rocket engines”43 completed those files in a 3d printing program and “3d printed the outer casings”44 he then documented the launch of his rockets on his property45 in terms of fuel propellant zahab opted for a mixture of potassium nitrate and sorbitol46 which are two of the precursors car has documented in precise proportions in use in islamic statemade propellantc zahab went so far as to purchase a 25 kilogram bag of stump remover made of potassium nitrate47 zahab created a video with an islamic state nasheed religious musical chant in the background detailing how accurate the rocket simulation software he was using was “as a validation tool”48 zahab discussed the content of the video with ullah but wrote he did not know “if they the islamic state actually tried it”49 it is not revealed in the court documents whether or not investigators believe zahab shared the video with the islamic state he also displayed an interest in realtime telemetry visualisation—telemetry being “the process of recording and transmitting the readings of an instrument”50 the prosecution alleged he was studying this topic “to assist him with his research and development” of rocket guidance systems51 zahab’s research stopped when the afp executed its first search warrant on his young property in april 201652 over the zahab family’s activities abroad—members of zahab’s family having traveled to syria to fight with the islamic state53 zahab was not arrested then but during the search the afp seized a number of encrypted devices54 decrypting and analyzing the information they contained took several months and led to a second search on the same property and to the eventual arrest of zahab in february 201755 the statement of facts which was agreed between zahab’s defense and the prosecution noted that “the work undertaken by the defendant and islamic state indicates significant commonality such as  a similar design work on a ‘grad’ rocket by the defendant to the ‘type 1’ and ‘type 2’ rockets developed and manufactured by islamic state  b research by the defendant into potassium nitrate sorbitol and sugar knsb as a composition for rock et fuel propellant and its use by islamic state in their rockets  c research into rocket guidance”56 d the prosecution wanted to show that zahab had not been working in isolation and that he knew his research was likely to be of interest to the group and therefore sought to pass his findings to them since the islamic state had become more and more reliant on its indigenous weapon production program to wage its expansion war in iraq and syria57 australian investigators were now able to show that there were correlations between the designs found on zahab’s computer and those built and used by the islamic state although it would be difficult to prove that zahab’s research was used by the islamic state to build rockets it would now be equally difficult to prove that it was not58 e car’s findings on the islamic state’s weapons programs the statement of facts itself drew upon car’s findings in describing the islamic state’s weapons’ research development and manufacture systems as “highly sophisticated and well organized with a huge output”59 indeed car’s findings drawn from extensive field research in iraq and syria between 2014 and 2018 show that the islamic state’s weapons production could be compared to an industrial revolution of terrorism similar to the industrial revolution of the late 18th to early 19th century that saw the end of the age of the artisan this industrial revolution of terrorism was characterized by a strong centralized management with quality control in place standardization of production and defined division of labor all resulting in a dramatic increase in output this was supported by a robust supply chain of raw materials and precursors and was driven forward by the group’s efforts at research and development60 since 2014 car has sent field investigation teams to embed with iraqi security forces to gather firsthand all available information on weapons and ammunition recovered from islamic state forces on the battlefield61 during their deployments car field investigation teams have gained unprecedented access to several weapon manufacturing facilities once operated by islamic state forces recorded extensive documentary evidence of centrally managed weapon production and documented a wide range of islamic statemanufactured ordnance recovered during ground combat operations although islamic state production facilities employed a range of nonstandard materials and chemical explosive precursors the degree of organization quality control and inventory management indicated a complex centrally controlled industrial production system in this system multiple manufacturing facilities worked to produce weapons according to precise technical guidelines issued by a central authority as car previously reported “the production of any one weapon system involved the coordinated input of numerous facilities at different stages of the production cycle from the processing of raw materials to the mixing of chemical explosive precursors to machining assembly and final signoff by dedicated quality control personnel”62 from its analysis of islamic state documents it found in iraq car determined that in order to function the group’s weapon production line required a sophisticated monitoring system in which manufacturing facilities regularly reported detailed figures on production rates and quality of output to a central procurement and production authority—all of which would have been critical to forecasting material requirements and ensuring that all manufactured weapons conformed to standard specifications islamic state forces operated an administrative unit called the central organization for standardization and quality control cosqc which fell under the authority of the group’s committee for military development and production itself part of the office of the soldiers the cosqc issued specific guidelines on weapon production parameters and controlled manufacturing quality standardization served critical battlefield requirements the directives issued by islamic state forces to production facilities sought to minimize the variation among weapons and ammunition manufactured by a multitude of often distant factories and workshops63 this enabled weapon interoperability which meant as car found that “mortar rounds manufactured in one part of islamic state territory were calibrated to fit mortar tubes produced in facilities located elsewhere”64 as car has previously stated65 consistency in production also requires consistency in the supply of materials used to manufacture weapons and ammunition is forces have demonstrated repeatedly that to ensure all weapon systems function identically they must be constructed from the same materials this is particularly so of chemical precursors used to manufacture explosives and propellant evidence documented by car during 29 months of operations along is frontlines indicates that is forces have made oneoff bulkprocurements of chemical precursors from single suppliers in other cases production dates spanning a range of years suggest that is forces have made repeated acquisitions of identical products from the same sources—almost exclusively from the turkish domestic market these findings indicate the mass diversion of chemical precursors and a robust supply chain extending from turkey through syria to mosul the supply of homogenous raw material clearly assists is forces in the production of uniform weapon systems documents issued by is forces and car’s physical examination of isproduced weapons underscore this the group’s central organisation for standardisation and quality control cosqc issues blueprints for weapon construction which provide standard parameters for the manufacture of mortars mortar rounds and rockets—in addition to the precise chemical mixes of explosives and propellant—using products of a specific type and origin car’s examination of weapons found whilst under construction in addition to those deployed with is forces and recovered on the battlefield confirm that production output conforms to these standards—usually to the tenth of a millimetre the functioning of this quality control system—illustrated by a stream of written directives and periodic reporting documented by car—provides deep insights into is forces’ broader command and control systems the group is highly bureaucratic adheres to strict reporting lines and operates a series of monitoring and evaluation mechanisms these are evident not only in periodic reporting by individual units on weapon production but also in regular updates sent to central authorities on rations ammunition expenditure rates weapon holdings by serial number and the health of fighters while technical in nature these findings must also be viewed within the framework of the islamic state’s efforts at the time to instill confidence among its fighters in its capacity as a ‘state’ administration the uniform painting labeling and branding of islamic stateproduced weapons and ammunition contributed to this although these measures such as defining the caliber and date of production clearly benefit weapon management—notably accounting—they also speak to the islamic state’s attempts to mirror the functions of a national military force these factors arguably legitimized the group’s capacity and coherence in the eyes of islamic state fighters as much as they served clear logistical functions as car indicated to the prosecution of zahab’s case66 islamic state forces conducted their research development and production across numerous facilities throughout their territory which can be broadly categorized as manufacturing mixing filling storage or repair modification and development facilities in particular the islamic state performed indepth research and testing of different weaponry systems as well as proofofconcept testing of rockets in 2015 prior to commencing largescale manufacture this research and testing resulted in islamic state forces producing two main design types of rockets on a mass scale as well as other types on a varying scale in the lead up to this manufacture the islamic state performed unique research and development into specific parts of the rockets which included the fin assembly nozzle motor body warhead fuse electric initiator and fuel propellant mixture and composition the research and development undertaken by the islamic state went beyond simple crude weapons development and involved precision manufacturing processes that were reproduced on a mass scale conclusion while it would have been interesting to see to what extent the prosecution may have been able to prove a direct correlation between zahab’s work and islamic state rocket production this was not necessary because of the guilty plea that said some similarities are undeniable in the design of some of the models in the composition of the propellant mixture in the timing of the testing of new models identically designated in the timing of the procurement of precursors and mass production of rockets and in potential research into guidance systems these similarities and the fact that zahab had been in touch with other individuals connected to the islamic state and had effectively transferred some of his findings to them support the possibility that his research may have contributed to the islamic state’s weapon production program67 with many foreign fighters and their relatives still detained in the syrian camp of alhol and elsewhere and their respective countries of origin still pondering what to do should they be repatriated law enforcement agencies are increasingly faced with the question of how to build criminal cases against these individuals in the case of haisem zahab car has shown that the evidence gathered in active conflict zones can play a key role in strengthening foreign prosecutions and should serve as a positive example     ctc damien spleeters is deputy director of operations at conflict armament research an organization investigating the diversion of weapons ammunition and precursors in conflicts around the world as a field investigator he has worked in iraq libya mali syria ukraine and yemen over the past five years he is the coauthor of a dozen publications on the islamic state’s supply chains follow damspleet substantive notes a with senior staff having decades of combined experience in conflict areas and with standard operating procedures refined over eight years of intense deployment and field investigation car works to uphold the highest standards of evidence verification and evidence chain of custody this is because car’s methodology requires physical access to evidence and firsthand documentation in an age of social media and opensource intelligence these methods may seem out of fashion but they allow car to painstakingly gather complete precise and verifiable data in nonpermissive environments the rifles cartridges missiles rockets chemical precursors circuit boards and detonators documented across the world form the more than half a million data points that allow car to better understand modern conflicts and what fuels them b in one communication zahab stated “i took inspiration from the iranian design and modelled it to materials dawlah islamic state had available and radius’s doable for them but had a hard time with competancy sic of measurements and weights on the other side and lack of competancy sic of quality data verification … actually i sent them a full chemical munitions cook book which explains all that” it can be inferred from the above

192,the consultative loya jirga called by president ashraf ghani to decide the fate of 400 taleban prisoners and whether they should be released to enable intraafghan peace talks has begun ghani has argued that according to the constitution and the penal code it was not in his power to release these prisoners and therefore he had to consult the people of afghanistan the question is whether a consultative loya jirga can – legally – provide him with that authority further confusing matters speaker of the lower house mir rahman rahmani has said the consultative loya jirga is illegal per se aan’s ehsan qaane has been unpicking the legalities and the politics behind today’s gathering  president ghani inaugurating the consultative loya jirga which he called to help him make a decision on the release of 400 taleban prisoners he said he did not have the constitutional power to do this photo presidential palace facebook page in his 29 july 2020 speech on the occasion of eid aladha president ghani spoke about the peace process and the 29 february agreement reached between the united states and the taleban that the afghan government release up to 5000 prisoners in return for up to 1000 government prisoners held by the taleban an english text version of his speech was uploaded on the presidential website here while aan’s analysis of the agreement can be read here ghani used the opportunity of this speech to “clarify” his position on the matter and to explain why according to him a consultative loya jirga was necessary  in the list that taliban provided to the government of the islamic republic of afghanistan of the 5000 prisoners they wanted to be released some 400 prisoners are included in the list that according to the afghanistan constitution and the afghan penal code the president of afghanistan has no authority to issue order on their release … i repeat it i do not have the authority to release them i have to consult with the nation and call for a consultative loya jirga to be able to make a decision on those 400 prisoners  according to the agreement the release was to have taken place by 10 march 2020 which was also to have been the first day of intraafghan negotiations it did not specify that the 5000 taleban prisoners would be chosen by the taleban or that they would give a ‘list’ of who they wanted which the government would have to comply with   the afghan government which was not a party to the agreement has since the beginning held the position that it was under no obligation to honour whatever was promised in the ustaleban agreement including the release of taleban prisoners in his 29 july speech ghani once again highlighted this point  even though the government of afghanistan was not bound by any commitments in the ustaliban agreement we released 4600 taliban prisoners from the list provided by the group to set the stage for beginning of peace negotiations  in his speech he announced that 500 other taleban prisoners “outside the list” would be released bringing the total number to 5100   the prisoner swap was the only taleban precondition for intraafghan peace negotiations initially president ghani had disagreed with this and insisted that a prisoner release could “not be a prerequisite for talks” but should rather be discussed during the negotiations see for example here he has however changed his position – under sustained us pressure – even though this meant the loss of an important bargaining chip   the taleban are demanding the release of the 400 prisoners left on their list before talks can begin the author wanted to look at the possible obstacles facing their release delving into the law raised a more fundamental question however of whether the president has legally released the other 5100 prisoners   who can pardon prisoners  the potential release of these particular 400 prisoners and the holding of a consultative loya jirga aimed apparently at trying to bridge a gap in the authorities of the president has raised several questions of law   in his 29 july speech ghani did not explain why exactly he was not able to decide on the release of these 400 prisoners himself rather he flagged that it was the constitution and the penal code that did not give him the authority to order their release his comments suggest that these prisoners were in a different category from the more than 5000 who have already been released after receiving the necessary presidential pardon since march however no detailed information on this issue has been released it is in this respect notable that more than 5000 prisoners have already been pardoned without apparent legal difficulty three senior members of the haqqani network anas haqqani mali khan and hafiz rashid were also pardoned and released in exchange for two kidnapped professors from the american university of kabul in november 2019   azadi radio quoted masum stanekzai who has been appointed head of the commission for holding the consultative loya jirga as saying that the 400 prisoners “are in four categories those supposed to be executed those involved in murdering kidnaping drug trafficking as well as financial and moral corruption” and that contrary to some reports no foreign prisoners were among them the four separate categories stanekzai referred to were not apparent from his words either in the original pashto or in the translated english moreover his comments also raised questions about why these particular prisoners were so very different surely there had at least been murderers among those already released moreover looking at the law stanekzai’s words only seem to be pertinent in one respect those convicted and sentenced to death according to the penal code can only have their sentence reduced to a lengthy prison term stanekzai’s statement therefore gets us little further forward  does the president have the power to pardon these prisoners  according to the constitution para 18 art 64 the president of afghanistan alone has the authority to pardon criminals or reduce their sentences however pardons have to be applied in accordance with the law the wording of paragraph 18 makes it clear that only those who have been convicted and sentenced can be pardoned those who are still under investigation or are currently being prosecuted cannot be moreover paragraph 1 of article 122 of the constitution which says “no law shall under any circumstances exclude any case or area from the jurisdiction of the judicial organ as defined in this chapter and submit it to another authority” also means the president does not have the authority to intervene in cases that are under investigation prosecution or trial there may be individuals on the list provided by the taleban who fall into this category there are a significant number of people in extended pretrial detention including those in the custody of the national directorate for security nds which the president cannot legally pardon  the condition that the president’s power to pardon is only ever “in accordance with the law” is mentioned in para 18 of article 64 of the constitution related to the taleban prisoners this makes two laws relevant   first is the law governing war crimes and crimes against humanity according to annex 1 of the amended criminal procedure code which came into force on 1 october 2018 war crimes and crimes against humanity can never be pardoned nor can those convicted of them see their sentences reduced some of the crimes committed by the taleban do rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity 1 however the ban on pardoning these crimes would only apply if the individuals had been convicted under this law moreover according to a source in nds who spoke to aan on condition of anonymity most taleban prisoners are convicted under a different law the law on crimes against internal and external security   second is the law covering amnesties the 2008 general amnesty and national reconciliation law‘amnesty law’ which provides an amnesty to all former fighters for acts committed during the war between 1978 and 2001 as well as to any fighters since 2001 so long as they agree to reconcile and accept the afghan constitution and other laws however there has been no evidence that the 5000 taleban prisoners have had to do this as a condition of their release those who have been convicted of crimes against internal and external security can also be pardoned based on the recommendation of the commission for strengthening peace – usually known by its dari name kamisyune tahkime solh however it was closed down in 2010   also to be stressed here is the spirit of the afghan legal system which has sharia as a major source it does not allow anyone except the actual victim with a claim against an individual criminal to forgive him or her even the amnesty law with its very blanket powers admits the ‘right of the individual’ haq ulabd to allow or block pardons read aan’s earlier analysis about a president power to pardon taleban prisoners here  also relevant here is that afghan law forbids taking political prisoners   summing up therefore it can be assumed that the taleban prisoners are criminals convicted of crimes under the criminal code or they were convicted of fighting against the government which is a crime according to the law on crimes against internal and external security which was merged into the penal code in 2017 there are legal obstacles to granting pardons for all these crimes also if they are still in the judicial process or have individual victims’ claims against them there would also be legal obstacles to pardoning them  based on the arguments laid out in this section the president may be right to say there are legal obstacles to releasing the remaining 400 prisoners however these obstacles would appear to apply not just to the 400 but to pardoning many of the 5000 taleban prisoners already released it is still not clear therefore why these 400 are different from the others or indeed why many of the releases already made could be considered to have been legally carried out   can a consultative loya jirga fill this legal gap  there is also already another legal problem with the particular form of loya jirga which president ghani has called a ‘consultative loya jirga’ does not exist in the afghan legal system it is not mentioned in the constitution and has not been enshrined in law this has been a problem with most of the loya jirgas called in recent years by both presidents hamed karzai and ashraf ghani see also earlier aan analysis here  and here  it is impossible to legally define its powers and role – although it is possible to say what a consultative loya jirga is not   firstly it is not the loya jirga mentioned in the constitution as “the highest manifestation of the will of the people of afghanistan” which has the power of deciding on issues related to independence national sovereignty territorial integrity supreme national interests amending the constitution and impeaching the president art 111 the reason for this is that it does not fulfil the constitutional definition of a loya jirga according article 110 of the constitution   the loya jirga consists of members of the national assembly and presidents of the provincial as well as district assemblies  afghanistan still has no elected district assemblies also called councils or shuras during earlier loya jirgas this shortcoming had been circumvented by a legal shortcut namely by filling those places from the elected provincial councils  secondly it is not the referendum which is described in article 65 of the constitution   on important national political social as well as economic issues the president can call for a referendum of the people of afghanistan the referendum shall not be contrary to the provisions of this constitution or require its amendment  in the original dari the term the referendum is described as a “general” araye umumi mardum referendum the official english translation left this word out it would appear to mean that a referendum based on the constitution must give all eligible citizens the right to participate not just a number of them or their representatives however this loya jirga as other recent ones has included selected participants only according to a letter from the independent directorate of local governance idlg to the provincial governors and councils only the participants of the 3 may 2019 consultative loya jirga have been invited to attend aan obtained a soft copy of the letter the total number of participants then is 3200   even if the gathering today could be considered a referendum – based on a generous reading of article 65 of the constitution – the constitution makes no mention of calling a referendum on judicial affairs releasing taleban prisoners is a judicial affair  thirdly today’s gathering is also not the parliament and nor does it have the parliament’s legislative authority as described in articles 8183 of the constitution as the highest legislative organ in the country the parliament could define a legal mechanism which could give the president the power based on article 64 of the constitution to pardon prisoners more on this below  all this makes clear that the ongoing loya jirga cannot make a legal decision about the release of the taleban prisoners nor can it give the president the legal authority to release prisoners this authority is simply not provided by any law it appears rather that the president aware of the country’s legal framework is now seeking advice from the gathering on how to deal with the issue of the prisoner release rather than it giving a legal ruling or bestowing authority this raises the question of what can be gained from a loya jirga since the president’s room to manoeuvre seems so very limited given both us and taleban pressure for the prisoners to be released as a prerequisite for direct peace talks before looking at this one other issue has come to the fore the opposition of the parliamentary speaker to the loya jirga  parliament rejects the legality of the consultative loya jirga  meanwhile condemnation of the jirga has come from the afghan parliament wolesi jirga speaker mir rahman rahmani in a meeting with president ghani on 4 august said the consultative loya jirga was against afghan law and stressed the role of parliament as the main constitutionbased legislative institution  according to the wolesi jirga’s media office rahmani argued that organising a consultative loya jirga in the presence of the people’s “true representatives” in the two houses of parliament was illegal as an alternative rahmani proposed the president “organise a joint and consultative meeting with members of the parliament” on the swapping of the 400 taleban prisoners the intraafghan peace talks and other important national topics according to the media office’s report which was posted on rahmani’s facebook page the meeting ended with no agreement although the report did not mention whether the members of parliament would attend the loya jirga it did mention that ghani had requested a meeting with all members of both houses no date for the requested meeting was mentioned in the report a separate report on the meeting published by the palace omitted rahmani’s rejection of the loya jirga  what can be done legally over the prisoners  this report has already outlined the legal problems president ghani faces in pardoning taleban prisoners in general however there may be solutions to the two specific constitutional obstacles that may be blocking the release of the 400 although neither would be through a consultative loya jirga   a first the president cannot intervene in cases which are not finalised by a final verdict of a court art 122 this means he cannot release those taleban who are still in detention centres and whose cases are still under investigation prosecution or trial   b secondly the right of the victim haq ulabd who has submitted a claim against an individual accused or convicted of a crime must consent to the release of that individual the president cannot forgive accused or convicted individuals on behalf of individual plaintiffs without their consent this right is enshrined in islamic sharia law which based on article 3 of the constitution the president cannot go against   as to the potential legal solutions for these two obstacles the president could request the supreme court to accelerate the judicial processes of those particular cases and after the final verdict he could pardon those convicted of crimes the president could also request individual plaintiffs to give their consent for prisoners whom they have claims against to be released  to use his constitutional power to pardon president ghani would need to deploy a law which discusses the mechanism for carrying out pardons as discussed above annex 1 of the criminal procedure law and the amnesty law both talk to some extent about such a mechanism the mechanism defined in the amnesty law is that those who have been convicted due to the commission of crimes against internal and external security can be pardoned on the recommendation of the commission for strengthening peace to the president as this commission has since been dissolved there is no other criteria or measure suggested by the law which the president can resort to in order to pardon these kind of criminals it would however be in the power of the president while parliament is in summer recess based on article 64 of the constitution to issue a presidential decree to define such a mechanism he could also request parliament to do this parliament itself could also initiate a move to define such a mechanism  if the constitutional loya jirga does not have any legal powers why even conduct it  in his 29 july speech president ghani said  the reason i am doing this is to enable the government of the islamic republic of afghanistan to remove all obstacles to peace  based on the ustaleban peace agreement the intraafghan negotiations were supposed to begin on 10 march 2020 after swapping “up to” 5000 taleban prisoners from government jails with “up to” 1000 members of the national security forces from taleban captivity as 5000 taleban prisoners have not been released the taleban have not agreed to start talks with the afghan government   president ghani has said he does not have the legal power to release the remaining taleban prisoners and the head of his negotiating team masum stanekzai has repeated this and therefore he called the jirga public perception however is that ghani called the jirga for political reasons with the aim of slowing down the peace process the impression that this may be the case has been strengthened by the fact that in some of ghani’s public speeches he has promised to deal with the peace process prudently and carefully and not allow himself to be rushed see for example here   some people believe he may be trying to hold out until after the us presidential election on 3 november 2020 for starting the talks in this view president donald trump in his quest for something that he can portray as a successful intraafghan peace agreement during his election campaign may be willing to sacrifice the current afghan government by holding up talks ghani might be trying as he sees it to lengthen the life of his government  those who believe that the president is trying to win time may see their view strengthened by the fact that this is the second time ghani has called a consultative loya jirga with the same participants to discuss peace with the taleban moreover in the last gathering on 3 may 2019 participants had already advised him to swap prisoners as a confidence building measure more details about jirga and its resolution here article 13 of the may 2019 jirga resolution aan’s translation said  all parties involved should treat the captives and prisoners of the other in an islamic spirit and with good behaviour and take actions using constructive and flexible methods aiming at the exchange of captives and release of prisoners for the purpose of further building confidence and goodwill between the two parties  the question raised therefore is why the president is going back to the same jirga with the same topic – and with all the legal obstacles still unresolved  at the same time however president ghani is not the only afghan concerned about the current peace process particularly as it may impinge on the rights of women minorities and the victims of war he may therefore have some public backing for what appears to be a delaying tactic

109,key points background keystone state skinheadskeystone united kssku is a regional racist skinhead gang based in pennsylvania while racist skinhead crews nationwide experienced a general decline over the last few years kssku continues to be one of pennsylvania’s most active white supremacist organizations the group’s public and private activity has been sporadic since its founding in 2001 kssku’s original slogan was “stand strong … stand true” but is currently “freedom through nationalism”  the group has also used “defending our heritage” their logo consists of a dramatized version of an american pitbull’s head inside a keystone striped in red white and black the colors of the nazi flag kssku has used this logo as the group’s “patch” which validated members would have tattooed on their bodies the group also sells apparel pins flags and other merchandise bearing the logo generally prospective members must serve a six to twelvemonth probationary period before they are granted full membership status and are expected to participate in many of kssku’s activities full membership in kssku is restricted to adult male residents of pennsylvania by invitation only the group does not permit women to be members but they are allowed to serve in a “supporting capacity” in late 2008 the group officially changed its name from keystone state skinheads to keystone united this was part of a calculated effort to sanitize their public image by rebranding the group as something other than violent racist thugs and simultaneously broadening its appeal to other white supremacists in 2011 one kssku member told a croatian white supremacist magazine “the name change came after we realized that the name word sic skinhead gives off negative thoughts to people and you’re only going to limit yourself to a particular subculture and type of crowd in order to gain public favor and draw a larger support base and to attract a wider variety of people the name went from keystone state skinheads to keystone united although both names tend to be used interchangeably kssku claims keystone state skinheads refers to the social component of the group and keystone united is the socalled “political activist” element over the years kssku has been aligned with and on occasion held events with a number of different white supremacist groups including the blood  honour social club vinlanders social club atlantic city skinheads maryland skinheads be active front and traditionalist workers party on their web site kssku states that “violence is against the policy of keystone united except in cases of selfdefense it is also against our policy to attack anyone on the basis of race verbally with racial slurs” despite this members and associates have criminal histories dating back to the group’s founding including charges of criminal violence for example less than a year after the gang was formed three members pleaded guilty to simple assault charges after assaulting a patron at a local diner in eastern pennsylvania in 2007 two kssku members were charged with and subsequently pleaded guilty to the brutal 1998 murder of two homeless men in florida and in 2018 kssku members were charged with ethnic intimidation and assault after allegedly hurling racial slurs at and then attacking an african america patron at a bar in a pittsburgh suburb origins kssku was founded in harrisburg pennsylvania in september 2001 as a statebased racist skinhead crew the goal of the keystone state skinheads was to “unite all racially aware skinheads in the state of pennsylvania” and “establish pennsylvania as one of the most racially active states in america” just a few months later members of kssku participated in a january 2002 white supremacist event in york pennsylvania which featured matthew hale national leader of the white supremacist pseudoreligious movement world church of the creator subsequently known as the creativity movement in addition to kssku members and creativity adherents attendees also included members of other white supremacist groups such as the hammerskins and national alliance the event which attracted hundreds of people including leftwing antiracists and anarchists erupted in violence that left several people injured and more than two dozen under arrest including one member of kssku following the york event kss began to bolster their numbers establishing regional chapters throughout the state  by 2003 kssku had active chapters in harrisburg philadelphia pittsburgh lancaster altoona and wilkesbarrescranton and soon after claimed to have additional chapters in chester county the lehigh valley state college and greensburg leadership the group has not had individual leaders rather it seems to be guided by a group of current members who are original cofounders or longtime members of kssku activity kssku activity has been inconsistent over the years they have organized both public and private events including white power concerts holiday gatherings public demonstrations and barbeques the group’s current website explains their purpose and efforts this way “we now intend to focus our efforts on raising awareness among whites through an increase in public activism and the creation of various outreach programs these programs have been designed in an effort to channel the frustration caused by today’s hostile atmosphere and the lack of options offered to our folk additionally these programs are intended to raise awareness about issues that have often caused many people to give in to their frustrations and lash out in the past” for the last several years kssku members and supporters have followed the trend of white supremacist propaganda campaigns such as banner drops and stickering stickers attributed to keystone united have been posted in communities across pennsylvania including on college campuses street signs light posts and other public structures the stickers promote the group while also sharing white supremacist talking points about white people being under attack  “defending our heritage since 2001” “whitelivesmatter” other stickers attempt to paint the group as socially engaged members of the community “no drugs on our streets” “defend our community stand up speak out” kssku stickering kssku banner drops involve large banners espousing antiimmigrant antisemitic andor violent rhetoric over heavily traveled roadways these banners promote the group and white supremacist language on immigrationborder security “secure our border” drugs “kill your local drug dealer” the 2nd amendment “defend the 2nd amendment” and warantisemitic conspiracy theories “jewish lies  saudi money  usa wars” tumblr kssku banner drops one of kssku’s most popular events is their annual “leif erikson day celebration” this public white supremacist gathering is held under the auspices of a celebration of the precolumbus nordic discovery of north america every october since 2007 kssku has held this event in philadelphia pennsylvania under police protection carrying the flags of scandinavian countries to a local statue of icelandic explorer thorfinn karlsefni as there is no local statue of erikson when they arrive at the statue participants give speeches about nordic explorers and express pride in their european andor nordic heritage in previous years antifa counterdemonstrators have disrupted the event by shouting down speakers and taunting participants in response kssku resorted to keeping event details private october 2018 marked the first time in more than 10 years that kssku did not hold their “lief erikson day celebration” presumably because a few days prior local activists removed the thorfinn karlsefni statue from its pedestal and threw it into the nearby schuylkill river tumblr ksskus 2017 lief erickson celebration day some kssku members have also gotten involved in local politics since 2016 two members of kssku from the wilkesbarrescranton area have successfully run for political office in 2012 kssku cofounder and longtime white supremacist steve smith was elected as a member of the republican party county committee in luzerne county as a writein candidate pittston’s 4th ward four years later smith was reelected with 69 out of 73 votes also in 2016 fellow white supremacist and kssku member ryan wojtowicz was elected to the republican party county committee for luzerne county pennsylvania nanticoke’s 4th ward steve smith and ryan wojtowicz kssku gettysburg pennsylvania  2017 additional activity from the late2000s to mid2010s it appeared that kssku’s activism had tapered off but in 2017 and into 2018 the group’s activity surged – especially at public events                  antidefamation league                  605 third avenue                  new york

63,by katherine lawlor with brandon wallace key takeaway iran is organizing a new effort to increase political and military pressure against us forces in an effort to compel an american withdrawal from iraq iran’s proxy militia groups are working with iraqi nationalist shi’a cleric moqtada alsadr to organize a “million strong march” on january 24 to oppose us troop presence in iraq sadr’s support lends additional credibility to the march and may enable iran’s proxies to generate a more significant protest than they otherwise would be able to achieve iran is also attempting to coalesce its lethal iraqi proxy militias and potentially sadr into a more unified military force to target us forces in the region iran faces some obstacles in doing so but the formation of an antius iraqi resistance front poses a significant threat even in its preliminary stages of organization tripwire iranian proxies and nationalist shi’a cleric moqtada al sadr are coordinating a joint “million strong march” against us troop presence in iraq on friday january 24 sadr announced the march on january 14 and major iranian proxies endorsed the march in subsequent days including leaders of badr kata’ib hezbollah asa’ib ahl alhaq and harakat alnujaba1 iran seeks to use this protest to apply additional political pressure on the us to withdraw from iraq and on iraqis to compel that withdrawal iran also seeks to use this march to coopt iraq’s popular protest movement sadr’s participation is an inflection because he ordinarily opposes iran’s proxies in iraq sadr’s support lends additional credibility to the march and may enable iran’s proxies to generate a more significant protest than they would otherwise have been able to organize pattern the upcoming “million strong march” is one element of iran’s reinvigorated effort to expel us forces from iraq iran began organizing its lethal iraqi proxies into a new “resistance front” which may include sadr after the us strike that killed irgcqf commander qassem soleimani and defacto pmf leader abu mehdi almuhandis on january 3 2020 iran’s proxies held a flurry of meetings in beirut lebanon and qom iran from january 913 to coordinate this resistance group and the millionstrong march lebanese hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah convened the first meeting in beirut the reported objective of the talks was to overcome internal and intramilitia divisions in order to establish a unified resistance movement to oppose us diplomatic and military presence in iraq2 before these meetings multiple proxy leaders had begun using similar language to describe “international resistance groups” “international resistance regiments” and an “iraqi resistance front”3 multiple proxy leaders then traveled to qom for further meetings with the new irgcqf commander as well as moqtada alsadr and his aides sadr and iran’s proxies subsequently announced the “million strong march”4 iran’s effort to create a new “resistance front” is still in its early stages and faces multiple obstacles including rivalries between its proxy militias nevertheless this attempt to establish an umbrella organization demonstrates that iran perceives a new requirement to organize its proxies as well as an opportunity to coopt sadr iran is likely concerned about reasserting firm control over its proxy network in order to ensure that its proxies do not act unilaterally following the death of their usual organizers soleimani and muhandis5 it is unclear whether sadr will join the “resistance front” as a military or political actor his support for the “millionstrong march” and “resistance front” is likely based in pragmatic selfinterest and may not last sadr is an iraqi nationalist who would prefer that both iran and the united states demonstrate respect for iraq’s sovereignty and withdraw their military forces he is a political and military competitor of the most prominent iranian proxy leader hadi alameri who fought for iran in the iraniraq war and is fundamentally loyal to iran’s supreme leader rather than to the sense of iraqi nationalism which animates sadr ameri was particularly close to irgcqf commander soleimani however sadr ameri and most iraqi shi’a politicians overcame their differences to pass a nonbinding resolution to expel us forces on january 56 sadr appears to have decided to align himself at least temporarily with ameri and iran’s proxies to pursue their shared interest of expelling us forces sadr is attempting to retain some independence even as he supports iran’s effort he ordered his followers who join the march to wave only the iraqi flag implicitly discouraging them from flying the pmf flag as iran’s proxies likely intend he explicitly forbade participants to “disclose in any way their religious ideological ethnic partisan military or jihadist affiliation” or to identify themselves as anything other than iraqi7 this order places a conscious distance between sadr’s iraqi nationalist motivations and the proiran sentiments of the proxy militias iraq’s highest shi’a religious authority grand ayatollah ali alsistani strongly warned against actors who may attempt to “exploit” the popular protests to “serve their own interests” in an indirect condemnation of iran and sadr’s effort8 less than fortyeight hours before the protests were scheduled to begin sadr released a statement further differentiating himself and his demonstrators from iran’s proxy militias a facebook post on a page which sadr uses to communicate with his followers stated that “the sadrist demonstrators are not among the undisciplined militias and we do not want them in our demonstrations”9 this statement sets the stage for three potentially conflicting demonstrations on friday the antiamerican demonstration of sadr the antiamerican demonstration of iran’s proxies and the continued appeals for government reform by iraq’s popular protest movement militia groups which may be involved in the iraqi resistance front timing iran’s effort to create a “resistance front” and a “millionstrong march” against the us in iraq is the next phase of its retaliation for the strike against qassem soleimani iran’s first phase included leveraging its political influence to support the nonbinding resolution in iraq’s parliament that asked the iraqi government to expel us forces on january 5 and the ballistic missile strike that attempted but failed to kill american personnel at a base in anbar and in iraqi kurdistan on january 818 the missile strike was an overt escalation by iran’s military iran then signaled its intent to pursue further escalation via proxies on january 9 the commander of iran’s islamic revolutionary guards corps aerospace force gave a press conference in which he stated that the missile strike was the start of a major operation across the region he stood in front of a number of flags depicting iran’s “axis of resistance” including iraq’s pmf the lebanese hezbollah the pakistani liwa zainebiyoun the afghan liwa fatemiyoun the hamas political office the irgc aerospace force the irgc and the iranian national flag19 the flurry of meetings between iranian proxy groups in beirut began the same day the us strike against qassem soleimani and abu mehdi almuhandis on january 3 was a turning point for sadr’s behavior in iraq his coordination of the march his potential involvement with the iraqi resistance front and his temporary political alliance with iran’s proxies are significant departures from his ordinary approach sadr is traditionally opposed to all foreign including iranian interference in iraqi affairs he has previously called for the dissolution of the pmf and has kept the funding training and organizational structure of his own militias separate from the pmf20 sadr also leads a bloc in the iraqi parliament that is a counterweight to iran’s proxy coalition and had been a dampener on iran’s influence prior to the january 5 resolution furthermore sadr previously supported iraq’s popular protest movement from iran’s proxies which see those protests as an existential threat to their interests21 the us strike that killed soleimani and muhandis changed sadr’s calculus regarding how to pursue his desire for a withdrawal of us forces making him more amenable to working with iran to do so assessment the scale of friday’s antius protest will be an important indicator of the combined influence of sadr and iran’s proxies but it is imperative to distinguish between new antius protests and the preexisting popular protest movement sadr’s support for friday’s antius protest is likely not enough to fully coopt the protest movement and may instead generate backlash from protesters clashes between different groups of protesters as well as iran’s proxies are likely sadr attempted to preempt this conflict by calling for the merger of these separate protest movements as two branches of the same “tree of reform”22 however this framing is unlikely to convince the protesters who are weary of political gamesmanship and often condemn sadr as part of the same political elite that enables government corruption and iran’s proxies furthermore sadr will not have control over iran’s proxy militias or their supporters iran’s most likely course of action mlcoa is to use even a limited success on friday to bolster its efforts to expel us forces via political pressure and limited and controlled military escalation politically iran will continue to portray the us presence as a threat to iraq’s sovereignty and security and will likely take further action via its supporters inside the iraqi parliament this effort may include forcing through a new prime minister and new legislation which suits iran’s agenda militarily iran will likely escalate through its proxies with the intent to erode the american will to remain in iraq and the middle east this will most likely include continued discrete attacks against locations containing us assets civilian and military such as indirect and occasional direct rocket fire on facilities that hold us troops or diplomats iran may also utilize its proxy network in iraq to take us persons hostage leveraging their safe return against a us withdrawal sadr’s kinetic support is not necessary to undertake this coa but his political support is invaluable to iran’s efforts   if iran does not feel that enough progress is being made it could escalate to the first most dangerous course of action mdcoa to use its proxy network and a potential sadrist alliance to launch a coordinated set of nearsimultaneous and lethal attacks against us persons forces or diplomats in iraq in an effort to make the political or military cost of a us troop presence in the region too high for the us to sustain iran will undertake these actions if it assesses that it cannot coerce the us to leave through discrete attacks this coa could include assaults against bases holding us forces or diplomatic facilities in baghdad or arbil sadr’s support is not necessary for iran to start down this path but the participation of his militia groups would render this coa substantially more dangerous historical precedent may lead iran and its proxies to believe that considerable us casualties hostagetaking and assassinations of us officials would force the us to pull out of iraq the us withdrew from lebanon in 1984 following the bombing of a us marine barracks and the kidnapping and subsequent killing of the cia station chief in beirut by likely iranian proxies alternatively or concurrently iran could attempt to assassinate us persons the iranian regime regards the us killing of soleimani to be an assassination and may order an “equivalent” assassination of a us official likely a current or former military commander or senior diplomat23  an alternate mdcoa is that sadr or one or more of iran’s proxies could conduct a major and independent escalation against us forces persons or diplomats without iranian knowledge or permission iraqi militia groups may be more willing or able to freelance pursuant to their own agenda rather than to iran’s military or diplomatic strategy without the supervision and control of soleimani and muhandis sadr and formerly sadrist splinters like aah leader qais alkhazali have historically been less receptive to iranian directives both previously operated as special groups during the us occupation of iraq and clashed with both us and iranianproxy forces both may choose to target us forces and personnel this mdcoa risks further escalation of the usiran conflict without either side deciding to kinetically escalate iran is likely attempting to mitigate this risk by working to establish renewed and more centralized control over its proxies implications iran’s campaign in iraq threatens both us forces and the iraqi popular protest movement that is demanding better governance iraqi sovereignty and basic rights the formation of an antius iraqi resistance front poses a significant threat even in its preliminary stages of organization each of these militias is individually capable of lethal attacks on us forces as is sadr’s movement together they could pose a more dangerous and united front their internal differences and fractious nature mitigates but does not eliminate this threat iran’s attempt to coopt the iraqi protest movement also threatens to undermine and discredit the preexisting popular movement and isolate it from international recognition or support which would itself be a victory for iran a coordinated effort by iran’s militias to crush iraq’s largely peaceful popular protest movement could also be devastating to iraq’s civilians especially if sadr decreases his backing of the protest movement furthermore deteriorating usiraqi relations have already damaged the efficacy of the usled antiisis coalition in iraq if us basing privileges at iraqi military bases are revoked the us would likely be unable to continue its counterisis fight in iraq or syria indicators indicators of the mlcoa would include a continuation of and relative escalation from the recent baseline—consistent indirect and discrete rocket fire at us forces and diplomatic facilities that causes few or no us or coalition casualties—as well as an increase in the kidnapping of us persons it would also include signs of renewed progress in negotiations over a prime minister replacement as well as other deals to introduce new legislation to the iraqi parliament possible indicators of the first irandirected mdcoa include a substantial increase in direct rocket fire and us casualties which could indicate that iran’s proxies are gearing up for greater escalation other indicators include signs of additional coordination between leaders of shi’a militia groups increased coordination between the shi’a militia groups and the sadrists and relocations of pmf units specifically if these groups begin to use the same name for their resistance movement appoint a leader or begin to make specific demands us forces and persons in iraq should be on high alert previously unknown shi’a militia groups popping up outside of the established iranian proxy network are also a significant potential indicator of this coa at least two indicators have already occurred reuters reported on january 4 that prior to his death soleimani was working to establish new proxy militia groups to conduct attacks on us forces with even greater deniability24 a new group calling itself saraya imam alhusayn alistishhadiya released a video on january 5 threatening to kill us soldiers in iraq to avenge the deaths of soleimani and muhandis25 possible indicators of the second militiadirected mdcoa include less cohesion between the iranian state narrative and the public statements of iraqi militia groups proxy militia leaders may begin to call on their own forces to exercise restraint indicating that they are concerned about their subordinates operating outside of their command  1 “influential iraqi cleric sadr calls for antius demonstrations” reuters january 14 2020  aliraqi saleh m facebook january 15

identified with an asterisk for the readers awareness the emergence of new leadership in the “axis of resistance” following qassem soleimani’s death may undermine the quds force’s role in leading the proxy network soleimani commanded the axis of resistance and reported directly to supreme leader ali khamenei circumventing the iranian armed forces’ chain of command leaders outside the quds force will likely seek to fill the power vacuum created by soleimani’s death the new quds force commander esmail ghaani lacks the qualities required to easily replace soleimani ghaani does not have soleimani’s stature relationship with khamenei experience or interpersonal connections in the middle east ghaani instead worked in afghanistan africa and latin america when he was quds force deputy commander and reportedly does not speak fluent arabic—unlike soleimani ghaani will likely struggle to cultivate the same effective relationships in the region that soleimani had ghaani’s less intimate relationship with khamenei may allow ghaani’s military superiors to subordinate him in a way they could not with soleimani islamic revolutionary guards corps irgc leaders—including its commander hossein salami—may seek greater operational control over the axis of resistance soleimani commanded iran’s external operations and proxy network largely independent of the rest of the irgc the irgc ground forces helped the quds force coordinate proxy operations in syria but operated under soleimani’s command framework salami may seek to build a distinct command echelon to bring the quds force back into the irgc hierarchy and better control iranian military and proxy activities abroad this goal may have motivated salami’s appointment of mohammad hejazi to ghaani’s old position–quds force deputy commander—on january 20 hejazi had a key role in integrating the basij organization with the irgc ground forces after khamenei appointed him as irgc deputy commander in 2008 hejazi previously commanded the basij from 1998 to 2007 salami may similarly hope to leverage hejazi to better integrate the quds force with the basij and irgc ground forces increasing salami’s control over iran’s external activities noniranian actors could also assume greater leadership in the axis of resistance lebanese hezbollah secretary general hassan nasrallah reportedly convened with iraqi proxy leaders in beirut at iran’s request to discuss overcoming internal divisions after soleimani’s death nasrallah’s mediation among iraqi proxies indicates tehran may increasingly rely on him to coordinate its proxy activities iran needs leadership in the axis of resistance—whether from the quds force or elsewhere—to moderate its escalation against the us the regime likely worries that soleimani’s death degraded its control over its proxies iran risks an inadvertent escalation with the us if iranianbacked militias take unilateral action against americans the institute for the study of war assessed this possibility and found that iran is likely working to establish more centralized control over its iraqi proxies to mitigate this risk read further on  new quds force leadership student protests   iran’s supreme leader appointed qassem soleimani’s successor supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei appointed soleimani’s former deputy brig gen first class esmail ghaani as quds force commander on january 3 khamenei stated that the quds force’s agenda will remain unchanged under ghaani irgc commander maj gen hossein salami later appointed brig gen first class mohammad hejazi as quds force deputy commander on january 20 ghaani lacks soleimani’s experience working in the middle east and interpersonal relations with iranian proxies ghaani has historically operated in secondary priority theaters to the quds force likely maintaining a division of labor with soleimani ghaani has traveled to afghanistan africa and latin america while soleimani typically worked in iraq syria and lebanon the us sanctioned ghaani in 2012 for facilitating the transfer of funds and weapons shipments to africa hejazi has experience suppressing protests and working in the field with iran’s proxies hejazi fought in the iraniraq war and has held senior positions in the irgc basij organization and armed forces general staff hejazi was also deputy commander of the irgc’s sarallah operational base which is responsible for suppressing protests and security threats in tehran the us sanctioned hejazi in 2007 hejazi was also likely a quds force liaison to lebanese hezbollah iranian media described hejazi’s most recent position as a field officer “in one of the resistance fronts” and “responsible for the irgc in lebanon” the israel defense forces claimed in august 2019 that hejazi commanded iranian personnel in lebanon and ran a precisionguided missile project with hezbollah   antiregime protests erupted in several iranian cities and universities after the irgc aerospace force shot down a ukrainian airliner on january 8 the protests began on january 11 after mourning ceremonies for the passengers the protests were primarily concentrated in tehran and comprised of students smaller demonstrations spread to other cities including esfahan and karaj protesters criticized the irgc and called for khamenei’s resignation the regime deployed the law enforcement forces to suppress the demonstrations the expansion of iran’s protest movement to include students in major cities could pose an increasingly complex security challenge to the regime iran’s last two major protest waves were the dey protests in late 2017 and early 2018 and the november 2019 gasoline riots these antiregime protests were concentrated in cities’ peripheries and iran’s border regions and mostly driven by economic grievances iran’s working class and economically disenfranchised youth were the main demographics present forecast iranian security forces would struggle to manage simultaneous mass protests in rural areas and cities the regime will maintain the will and capability to kill protesters however and will likely resort to lethal violence rapidly to quash a crossclass protest movement  iraq

democratic transition can be launched by negotiation opposition hopes of a peaceful resolution were raised on saturday after mr lukashenko held an unexpected meeting with political opponents in the jail where they are currently detained state media reported that the president called the meeting to discuss constitutional reform with his imprisoned opponents in nowfamiliar scenes thousands of proopposition protesters gathered in minsk and other major cities for the ninth successive sunday of demonstrations against mr lukashenko wearing coats and carrying umbrellas on a rainy afternoon protesters called for the resignation of 66yearold mr lukashenko belaruss leader since 1994 footage shows the security forces dressed in black and armed with batons rounding up peaceful protestors congregating in minsk city centre and taking them to waiting vehiclesâ  police used stun grenades and water cannon against demonstrators in minsk a spokeswoman for belaruss interior ministry told afp news agency they sprayed plain and coloured water at demonstrators covering them in what appeared to be orange dye some defiant protesters remained unmoved using their umbrellas to shield themselves from the blast a local news website described police using tear gas on crowds and said police were herding people into courtyardsâ   in videos posted online police can be seen beating protesters with batons and snatching their whiteandred flags  a symbol of nationalist opposition to mr lukashenko some protesters fought back and pelted police with bottles and other objects the viasna rights group which monitors detentions at political protests said at least 140 people had been detained in minsk and other cities journalists covering the demonstrations were among those detained including those from russias tass agency and the state belarusian news agency belta jonah fisher bbc ukraine correspondent sundays demonstrations in belaruss capital minsk now follow a familiar course  tens of thousands of people march through the streets demanding president lukashenko step down then he responds by sending his security forces to arrest as many of them as possible what makes this weekend different however is that on saturday president lukashenko held a long meeting with a group of political prisoners in jail its the first indication  after more than two months of protests  that he just might be willing to negotiate with the opposition the presidents press office said participants had agreed to keep the fourandahalfhour conversation secret however a photo posted by the press service shows mr lukashenko sitting at a table with 11 political figures all of whom look pale and unsmiling among them is viktor babaryko a banker who was initially seen as mr lukashenkos strongest rival in the election but was barred from running and jailed in july liliya vlasova a lawyer and member of the oppositions coordination council is also in the photo as is vitali shkliarov a belarusianamerican strategist who worked on us senator bernie sanderss presidential campaign a short video clip shared by the press service also shows mr lukashenko saying to the group i am trying to convince not only your supporters but the whole of society that we need to look at things more broadly apparently referring to the ongoing protests he added you cant rewrite the constitution on the streets opposition figures suggested meeting was a sign of mr lukashenkos weakness perhaps signalling a newfound eagerness to compromise with the protest movement but in a social media post ms

66,since the election of joe biden as the next us president reports of the death of the deal of the century have been greatly exaggerated the palestinian authority pa has felt a sense of relief that its love affair with israel and israels allies could finally resume  the pa had cut off official security coordination with israel in may and cooled relations with bahrain and the uae after they opened diplomatic relations with israel this summer the pa used the pretext that president donald trump’s “deal” was detrimental to palestinian interests   in the wake of biden’s election the pa declared the deal and annexation plans to be no longer on the table it officially resumed security coordination with israel citing assurances from israel that it would comply with prior agreements it had signed with the pa this came just days after israel opened bidding on the construction of a new jewish colonial settlement intended to cut off occupied east jerusalem from the west bank the pa has also restored its ambassadors to bahrain and the uae  these pa moves seek to appeal to biden who is expected to be more sympathetic to their cause than trump and so instead of announcing that the pa was looking forward to being welcomed back into the us capital the adamantly antipalestinian new york times the us newspaper of record announced that in a bold move to refurbish their sullied image in washington the palestinians are laying the groundwork for an overhaul to one of their most cherished but controversial practices officials say compensating those who serve time in israeli prisons including for violent attacks  israel has been demanding for decades that the pa not support the families of palestinians killed by israel let alone the families of palestinian prisoners of war the us congress repeatedly passed legislation to reduce aid to the palestinians by the amount of those payments” which were also cited by trump when he cut funding to the pa in 2018 biden will be little different from trump who in fact was little different from obama or previous presidents the new york times added that “palestinian officials eager to make a fresh start … are heeding the advice of sympathetic democrats who have repeatedly warned that without an end to the payments it would be impossible for the new administration to do any heavy lifting on their behalf”  this is an important example of how biden will be little different from trump who in fact was little different from obama or previous presidents biden has vowed not to move the us embassy back to tel aviv nor to rescind us recognition of israel’s illegal annexation of that city perhaps the only difference is that biden may restore aid to the pa while curtailing support to families of palestinian prisoners  details of which are being hammered out in ramallah according to the times   but as the deal of the century is predicated on the premise that the us and palestinians must give israel everything it wants it remains unclear why the pa thinks the deal is no longer on the table after all the pa has acted in accordance with that very premise by resuming security coordination with israel returning its ambassadors to the gulf states and negotiating cuts to support for prisoners’ families  all without getting anything in return  the issue of financial support to palestinian prisoners’ families is in fact a central feature of how the us “peace process” has always been premised on coercing palestinians and other arabs to join the us in legitimising israeli colonial conquests and delegitimising any resistance to them  since the 1993 oslo i accord the pa has committed to stamping out all palestinian resistance to israeli colonisation of palestinian lands collaborating with israel either by informing on or handing over resistors to israeli security forces or by having its own security agencies imprison or kill them why then israel and the us complain would the pa support their families this is to be contrasted with the fact that israel and the us have always rewarded israeli jews who massacre palestinians a minuscule number of israeli soldiers who kill palestinians have ever been prosecuted and even fewer found guilty as has been documented by israeli human rights groups and others  last year an israeli soldier who fatally shot an unarmed 14yearold palestinian boy was sentenced to a month in military prison the boy’s father told the new york times “this is unjust” he said he feared that the soldier’s sentence would “encourage his colleagues to kill in cold blood”  also last year the israeli army exonerated its soldiers in the killing of a palestinian doubleamputee protesting at the gaza fence who was shot in the chest the army said it could not ascertain that its soldiers were the ones who killed him another israeli border police officer who killed yet another palestinian teenager in 2014 was sentenced two years ago to nine months in prison having been praised by the judge as “excellent” and “conscientious”  as for the israeli military medic who shot dead an already injured palestinian lying on the ground in 2016 he was sentenced to 18 months in prison a year of probation and a demotion his sentence was later decreased to 14 months of which he served only nine before being released  these are neither aberrant nor new examples they harken back to the establishment of israel late israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin who expelled the palestinian population of the city of lydda in 1948 and devised the breaktheirbones policy against palestinians during the first intifada is celebrated in israel and the us as a hero for peace he never went to jail for his crimes   nor did former israeli prime minister ehud barak who dressed in drag headed a commando unit that assassinated several palestinian leaders in their homes in beirut in 1973 he like rabin is hailed as a hero  in october 1956 the israeli army committed a horrific massacre against its own israelipalestinian citizens in the village of kafr qasim when its soldiers shot dead 49 men women and children coming home from their fields after a day of work and injured dozens more   despite an initial government coverup a trial took place and prison sentences were handed down in october 1958 to eight officers ranging from eight to 17 years appeals were filed and all the sentences were reduced with all the convicted killers released by 1960 having spent their sentence in a sanatorium in jerusalem and not in a prison cell officer gabriel dahan convicted of killing 43 palestinians was appointed as officer responsible for arab affairs in the city of ramle in september 1960 the brigadier most responsible for giving the orders for the massacre yshishkar shadmi had a separate trial and was found guilty of a technical error and fined one cent  what biden and his friends are demanding of the pa today is precisely what israel and trump also demanded namely that it consider israeli conquest colonisation and occupation of palestinian land  including the killing of palestinians who resist or do not resist israel  as heroic acts since the pa did right by israel and the us when it agreed in oslo to quash any resistance to these israeli heroic acts it must continue to do so by not supporting the families of palestinian prisoners or martyrs  it has always been the same deal which is what trump tried valiantly to impress upon the world the goal of the pa as envisaged by the oslo accords is not only to obliterate any remaining resistance to israel but also to quash the palestinian people’s will to resist their insidious coloniser once and for all that was the essence of the us peace process in the 1970s and 1980s of the oslo deal of former us president bill clinton’s camp david offer in 2000 and of trump’s deal of the century   it has always been the same deal which is what trump tried valiantly to impress upon the world the muchawaited biden however will be sure to indulge the pa he will pretend alongside the pa that palestinians will get a new and better deal next time the views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not

129,alqa‘ida in the lands of the islamic maghreb is an algeriabased   sunni muslim extremist group it originally formed in 1998 as the   salafist group for preaching and combat gspc a faction of the armed   islamic group which was the largest and most active terrorist group in   algeria the gspc was renamed in january 2007 after the group officially   joined alqa‘ida in september 2006 the group had close to 30000 members at its height but the algerian government’s counterterrorism efforts have reduced gspc’s ranks to fewer than 1000 aqim historically has operated primarily in the northern coastal areas   of algeria and in parts of the desert regions of southern algeria and   the sahel but in recent years has focused on expanding into libya and   tunisia aqim employs conventional terrorist tactics including guerrillastyle ambushes and mortar rocket and ied attacks the group’s   principal sources of revenue include extortion kidnapping for ransom   and donations in june of 2009 the group publicly claimed   responsibility for killing us citizen christopher leggett in mauritania   because of his missionary activities in 2011 a mauritanian court   sentenced a suspected aqim member to death and two others to prison for   the american’s murder                    aqim since 2010 has failed to conduct the highcasualty attacks in algeria that it had in previous years multinational counterterrorism effortsâincluding a joint frenchmauritanian raid in july 2010 against an aqim campâresulted   in the death of some aqim members and possibly disrupted some aqim   activity in 2011 however aqim killed two french hostages during an   attempted rescue operation and in 2013 killed one french hostage in   retaliation for france’s military intervention in mali   aqim continues to hold one south african and one swedish hostage who   were abducted in 2011 and in june 2015 released an english language   video of the two in 2012 aqim took advantage of political chaos in northern mali   working with local tuareg national elements to take control of major   cities including kidal gao and timbuktu the islamic militant group   ansar aldin was formed to support the creation of an islamic state in mali ruled by sharia in 2013 aqim suffered setbacks in northern mali following the frenchled   military intervention in the region which caused them to lose control   of the major cities there and resulted in the deaths of a number of key   personnel as of 2015 however aqim was regrouping in parts of northern   mali and conducted a number of attacks on un forces in the region since 2011 dissident groups of aqim members broke away to form mujao movement for unity and jihad in west africa and almulathamun battalion and its subordinate unit almuwaqi‘un bildima   “those who sign with blood” led by former aqim battalion leader   mokhtar belmokhtar in august 2013 these groups merged to form almurabitun   and officially formalized the groups’ ties their stated goals are to   “unite all muslims from the nile to the atlantic in jihad against   westerners” and to curb french influence in the region in 2014 and 2015   additional aqim members split from the

201,advanced search september 18 2020  honor guard of republic of china at chiang kaishek memorial hall taipei city taiwain 2004 credit batiste pannetierfree art license a confrontation about taiwan is viewed by many as the most likely place where the rising tensions between the us and china may lead to an actual confrontation china has long sought to reincorporate taiwan into the mainland the risk is particularly high because the us has maintained an ambiguity about what it would do if china invades taiwan president xi jinping recently indicated that he is unwilling to continue to postpone the return of taiwan to chinese sovereignty indefinitely a goal of the communist party since chiang kaisheks nationalist government fled to taiwan in 1949 although china has pledged to seek a peaceful reunification it has recently suggested that it is willing to use its military to gain control over taiwan china has conducted military exercises drills and patrols in the taiwan strait which has increased taiwans concerns that after decades of threats china might actually be ready to proceed china is also increasingly using economic and political pressures on taiwan although the us has been bound to sell taiwan defensive weapons and to consider threats against it to be issues of grave concern for over 40 years the nature and extent of the us response to a potential chinese attack is undefined the wall street journal reported on aug 31 however the us has never specified how washington would react to a chinese attack one of the leading experts on foreign affairs robert kagan of the brookings institution asks under the heading chinas dangerous taiwan temptation is the trump administration ready to respond to a chinese attack or threatened attack on taiwan would a biden administration be are the american people are we prepared to go beyond statements and sanctions if the chinese call our bluff american policies in the two decades before world war ii were shaped by what in retrospect looks like a stunning naiveté about other nations willingness to resort to force one wonders if we are any less naive today in his washington post column george f will put the situation in dramatic terms the biden administrations first grave test approaches not silently on little cats feet but in the noisy stomping of totalitarians boots in 2021 taiwan might provide the most perilous us moment since the cuban missile crisis of 1962 to avoid this conflict the next president would do well to head the suggestions of richard haass and david sacks president and research fellow respectively at the council on foreign relations in foreign affairs they argue that the time has come for the united states to introduce a policy of strategic clarity one that makes explicit that the united states would respond to any chinese use of force against taiwan waiting for china to make a move on taiwan before deciding whether to intervene is a recipe for disaster the white house could articulate this new policy through a presidential statement and accompanying executive order that reiterates us support for its onechina policy but also unequivocally states that the united states would respond should taiwan come under chinese armed attack the statement would make clear that the united states does not support taiwan independence i could not agree more here is the way i put the same idea in 2017 in avoiding war with china the united states should make explicit what is viewed by many as an implicit understanding between china and the united states regarding the status of taiwan the american and chinese governments have already demonstrated considerable selfrestraint in the matter of taiwan beijing has not yielded to demands from those who call for employing force as a means for reclaiming taiwan as part of the mainland meanwhile washington has not yielded to americans who urge the recognition of taiwan as an independent country these measures of selfrestraint should be made more explicit by letting it be known that so long as china does not use force to coerce taiwan to become part of china the united states will continue to refrain from treating taiwan as an independent state the prevailing understanding between the united states and china is opaque although some experts in international relations say an understanding exists some suggest the substance of such an understanding exists some suggest the substance of such an understanding is unclear and still others hold no such understanding has ever existed in view of these rising tensions between the us and china and the risks that always rise when there are presidential elections and a potential change in power much is to be gained if the most likely point of tensions the conflict about taiwan is defused all this assumes that trump will not throw taiwan under the bus as part of a trade deal this possibility has been cited by the economist on september 5 in his memoir published this year john bolton one of mr trumps discarded national security advisers speculates that taiwan might well be the next american ally to be jettisoned by his former boss as a global times commentator put it this month taiwan for the us is only a tradable chess piece after all mr trump has always put america first trade concessions have always seemed to matter more to him than alliances amitai etzioni is a

199,advanced search november 9 2020  washington dc november 7 2020 credit ted eytan cc this article first appeared on the ethics  international affairs blog a month ago on the doorstep podcast nahal toosi who is politicos foreign affairs reporter discussed the competing narratives and policy preferences within the big tent of the democratic party and how in the event that the bidenharris ticket prevailed in the presidential contest all of this might play out she observed    former us officials who know him predict the former vice president will seek a middle path that is far from trump and somewhat to the left of obama but nowhere near what some progressives would like to see as was noted in this space senate democrats made their preelection pitch to shape the direction of us foreign policy in the 2020s trying to unite a melange of different perspectives in listening to the presentation made by senator robert menendez dnj i thought i heard elements of the restorationist narrative of returning to a pre2016 bipartisan consensus and both menendezs remarks and the overall tenor of the report reject any hint of transactionalism as a guiding precept in foreign policy especially with illiberal or authoritarian regimes at the same time menendez also sounded themes that connect to the reindustrializationregeneration narrative—that america is better positioned to lead abroad if it starts by rebuilding capacities at home and the democratic community narrative—of again prioritizing democracy and human rights and being able to work with allies and close partners to share technologies and focus on improvements both of these also implicitly speak to the need to connect foreign policy to doorstep concerns especially economic ones of voters it should also be noted that toosi as well notes the emphasis in the bidenharris platform on those types of concerns but narratives gain traction as a result of actual individuals being elected and those individuals who are elected feeling responsive to the concerns expressed by their voters and supporters this is why josh rogins reporting of what might happen in the event joe biden is president but the senate remains in republican hands is so important this suggests that what might emerge would in fact be a largely restorationist approach a last chance to return to a bipartisan internationalist foreign policy that moderate republicans and democrats have long championed the end result would be one in which newer narratives particularly about human rights and the environment might receive less attention which brings us to the current episode of the doorstep with tom nichols taking a first look at the results of the elections narratives matter when people win elections and when those who win elections believe that something matters to their core supporters so far the 2020 elections have demonstrated the limits in the electoral reach of those who would want to put forward newer narratives this is a story which is still in flux as votes continue to be counted but something to keep tabs on as we move forward nikolas k gvosdev us naval war college carnegie council senior fellow us global engagement programview bio us global engagement usgedemocracy human rights international relations international trade us foreign policy united states  © 2020  carnegie council  170 east 64th street new york ny 10065  2128384120  infocceiaorg the views and opinions expressed in the media comments or publications on this website are those of the speakers or authors and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions held by carnegie council,3

125,ansar bayt almaqdis abmâalso known as the islamic state of iraq and the levant isilsinai provinceâis the most active and capable terrorist group operating in egypt abmâwhich pledged allegiance to isil in november 2014 becoming isil’s sinai provinceâseeks   the destruction of israel and the establishment of an islamic emirate   and implementation of sharia in the sinai peninsula the group is based   in the sinai but in fall 2013 expanded its operational reach into egypt’s nile valley abm emerged in 2011 when it claimed responsibility for a crossborder attack into southern israel from the sinai since 2011 abm has carried out additional crossborder   attacks launched rocket attacks against israel and repeatedly bombed   the gas pipeline in the sinai that supplies natural gas to israel and jordan following the august 2013 crackdown by egyptian security forces on   those protesting the ouster of president muhammad mursi abm launched a   campaign of attacks against egyptian government and security targets   abm since then has claimed responsibility for several of the highestprofile   and sophisticated attacks in egypt including an attempted   assassination of the egyptian minister of the interior the downing of   an egyptian military helicopter in the sinai with a surfacetoair missile and several deadly vehicleborne   improvised explosive device attacks against egyptian security   installations abm for the first time demonstrated its willingness to   target civilians when it claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing on   a tourist bus in the sinai in february 2014 though abm described the   attack as targeting egyptian economic interests the group also claimed   responsibility for an august 2014 carjacking in egypt’s   western desert that killed a us oil worker since announcing its formal   alignment with isil in late 2014 abm has conducted several of its most   lethal and sophisticated attacks to date and has continued to focus   attacks primarily against egyptian government and security targets   however the group claimed responsibility for a june 2015 rocket and   mortar attack against the multinational force and observers mfo base   in the sinai the first terrorist attack against mfo facilities abm has not made explicit threats against the west or western   targets in its official propaganda however the group views the west   and the united states in particular as supporters of israel and egypt   and expresses antiwestern sentiment in its rhetoric   various social media accounts claiming association with the group have   posted threats to us and other western targets although abm has   repeatedly denied a social media presence the us state department designated abm as a foreign terrorist organization in april 2014 the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign asset control has designated several abmaffiliated persons and groups as specially designated nationals

arabic names and terms this edition of the counterterrorism calendar adheres to a transliteration system that is generally used throughout the us government in this system the letters âuâ and âaâ are preferred over âoâ and âeâ for example the name of the alqaâida operative who was detained on 1 march 2003 is khalid shaykh muhammad not khalid sheikh mohammed he was an associate of usama bin ladin not osama bin laden we have retained however the spellings used on the rewards for justice and fbi terrorism sites spellings there are designed for easy recognition or are used in legal documents and therefore do not always conform to these rules the islamic calendar is based on the movement and observation of the moon the islamic year contains 12 months none of which can exceed 30 days each month starts when the lunar crescent is first seen after a new moon because 12 lunar months multiplied by 2953 days equals 35436 days the islamic calendar will always be approximately 11 days shorter than the western gregorian calendar for example 1 muharram the first day of islamic year 1437 known in the west by the latin term anno hegirae or ah fell on 14 october 2015 in ah 1438 1 muharram falls on 2 october 2016 because of lunar observation and differences in time zones the observance of islamic holidays and calendar dates may vary from region to region
